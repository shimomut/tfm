# TFM Archive Operations Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive archive operations for TFM with full cross-storage support, enabling users to create and extract archives between any combination of local and S3 storage.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **tfm_archive.py** - Main archive operations module
   - `ArchiveOperations` class with cross-storage support
   - Support for multiple archive formats
   - Temporary file handling for cross-storage operations
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging

2. **Archive Format Support**
   - **Multi-file archives**: ZIP, TAR, TAR.GZ, TAR.BZ2, TAR.XZ
   - **Single-file compression**: GZIP, BZIP2, XZ
   - **Format detection** from file extensions
   - **Content listing** without extraction

3. **Cross-Storage Architecture**
   - Uses tfm_path abstraction for storage independence
   - Temporary file staging for cross-storage operations
   - Automatic cleanup of temporary files
   - Support for all storage combinations (Local ↔ S3)

### External Tools

Created three shell scripts in `tools/` directory:

1. **create_archive.sh** - Interactive archive creation
   - Format selection (tar.gz, tar.bz2, tar.xz, zip, tar)
   - Uses TFM environment variables
   - Progress feedback and error handling

2. **extract_archive.sh** - Interactive archive extraction
   - Auto-detection of archive formats
   - Multiple extraction destination options
   - Overwrite protection and confirmation

3. **archive_info.sh** - Archive information display
   - Detailed archive metadata
   - Content listing with file counts
   - Size and compression information

### TFM Integration

1. **Main Interface Updates**
   - Enhanced existing archive operations with cross-storage support
   - Integrated new ArchiveOperations class
   - Improved format detection and error handling
   - Progress tracking for large operations

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - Added archive tools to external programs menu
   - Maintained existing key bindings (P/p for create, U/u for extract)
   - Added confirmation settings for archive operations

3. **Key Features**
   - **P/p** - Create archive from selected files
   - **U/u** - Extract selected archive
   - **x** menu - Access to archive tools
   - Progress tracking for large operations
   - Cross-storage operations (Local ↔ S3)

### Supported Operations

#### Archive Creation
- **Local to Local** - Traditional archive creation
- **S3 to Local** - Download S3 files, create local archive
- **Local to S3** - Create archive locally, upload to S3
- **S3 to S3** - Download S3 files, create archive, upload to S3

#### Archive Extraction
- **Local to Local** - Traditional archive extraction
- **Local to S3** - Extract local archive, upload files to S3
- **S3 to Local** - Download S3 archive, extract locally
- **S3 to S3** - Download S3 archive, extract, upload to S3

#### Archive Information
- List contents without extraction
- Display file sizes and types
- Show compression ratios
- Support for all archive formats

### Technical Features

1. **Error Handling**
   - Specific exception handling for different error types
   - Graceful degradation for unsupported formats
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Automatic cleanup on failures

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Streaming operations for large files
   - Efficient temporary file management
   - Progress tracking for user feedback
   - Memory-efficient cross-storage operations

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Path traversal protection during extraction
   - Secure temporary file handling
   - Permission preservation where supported
   - Validation of archive contents

### Testing and Validation

1. **Comprehensive Test Suite** (`test/test_archive_operations.py`)
   - Unit tests for all archive formats
   - Integration tests for cross-storage operations
   - Error handling and edge case testing
   - Round-trip testing (create → extract → verify)

2. **Demo Script** (`demo/demo_archive_operations.py`)
   - Interactive demonstration of all features
   - Local and cross-storage operation examples
   - Performance and compression testing
   - S3 integration examples

3. **Test Results**
   - All 14 test cases passing
   - Format detection working correctly
   - Overwrite protection functioning properly
   - Cross-storage operations validated

### Documentation

1. **Feature Documentation** (`doc/ARCHIVE_OPERATIONS_FEATURE.md`)
   - Comprehensive user guide
   - Technical implementation details
   - Configuration options
   - Troubleshooting guide

2. **API Reference**
   - Complete method documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Error handling patterns
   - Integration guidelines

## Usage Examples

### Creating Archives

```bash
# In TFM:
# 1. Select files with Space
# 2. Press P
# 3. Enter filename: backup.tar.gz
# Archive created in other pane
```

### Cross-Storage Operations

```bash
# S3 to Local Archive:
# 1. Navigate to S3 bucket (left pane)
# 2. Select S3 files with Space
# 3. Navigate to local directory (right pane)
# 4. Press P to create local archive from S3 files
```

### External Tools

```bash
# Access via 'x' menu:
# - Create Archive (interactive format selection)
# - Extract Archive (destination options)
# - Archive Information (detailed metadata)
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Cross-Storage Support**
   - Seamless operations between local and S3 storage
   - No storage-specific code in FileManager class

# Cursor Highlighting Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the batch rename dialog to use professional reversed color highlighting for cursor indication instead of the underscore character, providing a more polished and intuitive user experience.

## Visual Improvement

### Before
- Cursor shown as underscore character (`_`) inserted into text
- Could be confusing when underscore is part of the actual text
- Less professional appearance
- Cursor position not immediately obvious

### After
- Cursor shown using reversed color highlighting (inverted background/foreground)
- Character at cursor position is highlighted with reversed colors
- At end of text, a highlighted space shows cursor position
- Professional, modern text editor appearance
- Cursor position immediately visible

## Technical Implementation

### New Helper Method
Created `_draw_input_field_with_cursor()` method that handles:
- Text rendering with cursor highlighting
- Horizontal scrolling for long text
- Cursor positioning at character boundaries
- Empty field cursor display
- Active/inactive field visual states

### Key Features

#### Smart Text Scrolling
- Automatically scrolls long text to keep cursor visible
- Centers cursor in view when possible
- Shows beginning of text when cursor is near start
- Shows end of text when cursor is near end

#### Cursor Display Logic
```python
# Character at cursor position gets reversed colors
if i == cursor_in_visible and is_active:
    self.safe_addstr(y, current_x, char, base_color | curses.A_REVERSE)

# End-of-text cursor shown as highlighted space
if cursor_in_visible >= len(visible_text) and is_active:
    self.safe_addstr(y, current_x, " ", base_color | curses.A_REVERSE)
```

#### Boundary Handling
- Cursor position clamped to valid text boundaries
- Handles empty text fields gracefully
- Manages text overflow with intelligent scrolling
- Prevents cursor from going out of bounds

## User Experience Benefits

### Visual Clarity
- Cursor position is immediately obvious
- No confusion with underscore characters in filenames
- Consistent with modern text editor conventions
- Professional appearance

### Accessibility
- High contrast cursor highlighting
- Works with different color schemes
- Clear visual feedback for active field
- Intuitive for users familiar with standard text editors

### Functionality
- Maintains all existing cursor movement features
- Preserves text editing capabilities
- Supports long filename patterns with scrolling
- Handles edge cases (empty fields, text boundaries)

## Implementation Details

### Color Attributes
- Uses `curses.A_REVERSE` for cursor highlighting
- Combines with existing field styling (bold for active field)
- Maintains color scheme consistency
- Works with terminal color capabilities

### Text Window Management
- Calculates visible text window based on available width
- Adjusts window position to keep cursor in view
- Handles text longer than display width
- Provides smooth scrolling experience

### Performance
- Efficient character-by-character rendering
- Minimal computational overhead
- No impact on existing functionality
- Maintains responsive user interface

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`test_cursor_highlighting.py`) that validates:
- Cursor highlighting at various positions
- Text scrolling behavior for long strings
- Empty field cursor display
- Active/inactive field states
- Boundary condition handling

All tests pass, confirming robust cursor highlighting implementation.

## Visual Examples

### Short Text
```
Regex Pattern: hello[w]orld
                    ^
                 cursor here
```

### Long Text (scrolled)
```
Regex Pattern: ...long_[f]ilename_pat...
                        ^
                    cursor here
```

### End of Text
```
Regex Pattern: pattern[ ]
                       ^
                   cursor here
```

### Empty Field
```
Regex Pattern: [ ]
               ^
           cursor here
```

## Benefits

1. **Professional Appearance**: Matches modern text editor standards
2. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Cursor position immediately obvious
3. **No Text Confusion**: No interference with underscore characters
4. **Accessibility**: High contrast highlighting for better visibility
5. **Consistency**: Familiar cursor behavior for all users

The cursor highlighting enhancement significantly improves the visual polish and usability of the batch rename dialog, making it feel like a professional text editing interface while maintaining all existing functionality.

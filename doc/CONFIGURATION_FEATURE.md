# TFM Configuration Feature

## Overview

TFM is customized through a Python configuration file. On first run TFM creates it
from a template; edit it to change appearance, behavior, key bindings, and
external-program integration. Every option below is a real attribute of the
config class — see `src/_config.py` for the authoritative, fully-commented
template.

## Configuration File Location

TFM stores its configuration in:

```
~/.tfm/config.py
```

On first run, TFM creates this file with default settings. You can edit it with
any text editor.

## Quick Start

```bash
# View it
cat ~/.tfm/config.py

# Edit it
vim ~/.tfm/config.py        # or: nano / code / your editor of choice
```

Changes take effect the next time you start TFM.

## Editing and Reloading Config

You can also edit and apply your config without leaving TFM. Both actions live
under the **Tools** menu (neither is bound to a key by default):

- **Edit Configuration…** opens `~/.tfm/config.py` in your configured
  `TEXT_EDITOR`, creating it from the template first if needed. With a terminal
  editor (e.g. `vim`) TFM reloads automatically when you save and quit; with a
  GUI editor (e.g. VS Code) TFM can't tell when you're done, so save and then run
  **Reload Configuration**.
- **Reload Configuration** re-reads `~/.tfm/config.py` from disk and applies it
  without opening an editor — handy when you edit the file in a separate window.

To bind either action, add it to `KEY_BINDINGS`:

```python
KEY_BINDINGS = {
    'edit_config':   ['Y'],
    'reload_config': ['Ctrl-R'],
}
```

Reloading applies **live** to key bindings, file associations, external programs,
favorite directories, confirmation prompts, and the text-editor / diff-tool
settings. Themes and post-effects, fonts (desktop mode), the pane-split and
log-height ratios, and file-monitoring intervals are read once at startup and
only fully apply on the **next launch**. TFM logs a reminder after each reload.

If your edited config has a Python error, TFM logs it and falls back to built-in
defaults rather than crashing; out-of-range values are still applied but logged
as a `Config warning:`.

## Appearance

### Fonts (GUI / desktop mode only)

These apply when running on the native macOS backend (`tfm.py --backend gui`);
the terminal backend uses your terminal's font and ignores them.

```python
UI_FONT_NAME  = None   # proportional face for names/labels (None = bundled/OS default)
MONO_FONT_NAME = None  # monospaced face for the aligned grid (None = bundled default)
FONT_SIZE      = 12    # point size applied to BOTH faces (8-72)
```

`MONO_FONT_NAME` must be a monospaced font; the on-screen grid is derived from its
glyph box. In desktop mode you can also change `FONT_SIZE` live with `Cmd-+` /
`Cmd--`.

### Themes / colors

TFM ships with built-in themes (Dark+, Monokai, Dracula, Nord, Solarized, Gruvbox
Dark, Light+, Solarized Light). Switch at runtime via **View → Theme** or the `T`
key; TFM starts on Dark+ and remembers the last theme across restarts. There is no
`COLOR_SCHEME` string setting — instead you register your own named themes:

```python
THEMES = {
    'Ocean': {                    # builds on Dark+ by default
        'accent':     (0, 120, 160),
        'background': (18, 26, 32),
    },
}
```

See [Color Schemes](COLOR_SCHEMES_FEATURE.md) for the full theme key reference
(including the optional GUI `post_effect` CRT/phosphor look).

## Display and Layout

```python
SHOW_HIDDEN_FILES       = False  # show dotfiles (toggle at runtime with '.')
DEFAULT_LEFT_PANE_RATIO = 0.5    # left pane width as a ratio (0.1 - 0.9)
DEFAULT_LOG_HEIGHT_RATIO = 0.25  # log pane height as a ratio (0.1 - 0.5)
DATE_FORMAT             = 'short'  # 'short' (YY-MM-DD HH:mm) or 'full' (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss)
SEPARATE_EXTENSIONS     = True   # show extensions in their own column
MAX_EXTENSION_LENGTH    = 5      # longer extensions stay with the filename
```

Adjust the pane split at runtime with `[` / `]`, and the log-pane height with
`{` / `}`.

`DATE_FORMAT` chooses how modification times are shown in the file panes:
`'short'` gives `YY-MM-DD HH:mm` (compact, no seconds) and `'full'` gives
`YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` (four-digit year plus seconds). Both use ISO-8601 ordering,
and the date column widens automatically for the longer form. You can also cycle
the format live from the **View Options** menu (`z`) without editing the config.

## Sorting

```python
DEFAULT_SORT_MODE    = 'name'   # 'name', 'size', or 'date'
DEFAULT_SORT_REVERSE = False
```

Change sorting at runtime via the sort menu (`s`) or the quick-sort keys.

Name sorting is **natural** (alphanumeric): embedded numbers are compared as
numbers, so `file2` sorts before `file10`, and leading zeros (`Report001`,
`Report010`) order as expected. It is case-insensitive, always applies to the
`'name'` sort mode, and can't be turned off; the `'size'` and `'date'` modes are
unaffected. Directories are always listed before files regardless of sort mode.

## Confirmations

```python
CONFIRM_DELETE          = True   # before deleting files/directories
CONFIRM_QUIT            = True   # before quitting TFM
CONFIRM_COPY            = True   # before copying
CONFIRM_MOVE            = True   # before moving
CONFIRM_EXTRACT_ARCHIVE = True   # before extracting an archive
CONFIRM_ARCHIVE_CREATE  = True   # before creating an archive
```

## Key Bindings

```python
KEY_BINDINGS = {
    'quit': ['Q'],
    'help': ['?'],
    'toggle_hidden': ['.'],
    # ... many more actions
}
```

Each action maps to a list of keys. Keys can be single characters (`'a'`, `'Q'`)
or special names (`'HOME'`, `'END'`, `'F1'`…`'F12'`, `'UP'`, `'DELETE'`, …). Letter
keys are **case-insensitive**: a bare `'q'` and a bare `'Q'` bind the *same*
physical key (the default template simply happens to spell them uppercase, e.g.
`'Q'`, `'C'`, `'M'`, `'K'`). To bind the shifted/uppercase variant on its own, use
`Shift-<letter>` (e.g. `'Shift-F'`). Non-alphabet characters such as `'?'` and
`'/'` stay case-sensitive.

Some actions use the extended, selection-aware form:

```python
KEY_BINDINGS = {
    'copy_files':       {'keys': ['C'], 'selection': 'required'},
    'create_directory': {'keys': ['M'], 'selection': 'none'},
}
```

Selection modes: `'any'` (default), `'required'` (only with a selection), `'none'`
(only without one). See [Key Bindings](KEY_BINDINGS_FEATURE.md) for the full
action list.

## Favorite Directories

```python
FAVORITE_DIRECTORIES = [
    {'name': 'Home', 'path': '~'},
    {'name': 'Documents', 'path': '~/Documents'},
    {'name': 'Projects', 'path': '~/Projects'},
]
```

Access favorites with the `J` key. See [Navigation Dialogs](NAVIGATION_DIALOGS_FEATURE.md).

## History and Logging

```python
MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES = 100    # directory-history entries kept
MAX_LOG_MESSAGES    = 1000   # messages retained in the log pane
```

See [Logging](LOGGING_FEATURE.md).

## Progress Animation

```python
PROGRESS_ANIMATION_PATTERN = 'spinner'  # spinner, dots, progress, bounce, pulse, wave, clock, arrow
PROGRESS_ANIMATION_SPEED   = 0.2        # frame interval in seconds
```

## External Tools

```python
# Editor launched by edit_file. String ('vim') or list (['code', '--wait']).
# Defaults are chosen per backend: 'vim' in the terminal, 'code' in desktop mode.
TEXT_EDITOR = 'code' if is_desktop_mode() else 'vim'

# Diff tool launched from the diff viewers. Same string/list forms.
TEXT_DIFF   = ['code', '--diff'] if is_desktop_mode() else 'vimdiff'
```

### External Programs

```python
PROGRAMS = [
    {'name': 'Git Status', 'command': ['git', 'status']},
    {'name': 'Disk Usage', 'command': ['du', '-sh', '*']},
]
```

Each entry has a `name`, a `command` (list or string), and optional `options`
(e.g. `{'auto_return': True}`). Access programs with `x`. See
[External Programs](EXTERNAL_PROGRAMS_FEATURE.md).

### File Associations

```python
FILE_ASSOCIATIONS = [
    {'pattern': '*.pdf', 'open|view': ['open', '-a', 'Preview']},
    {'pattern': ['*.jpg', '*.jpeg', '*.png', '*.gif'], 'open|view': ['open', '-a', 'Preview']},
]
```

Each entry has a `pattern` (single fnmatch string or list) and one or more of
`open` / `view` / `edit` (or the combined `open|view`). Commands are lists or
strings. See [File Associations](FILE_ASSOCIATIONS_FEATURE.md).

## Caches

```python
S3_CACHE_TTL          = 60    # S3 directory-listing cache TTL (seconds)
SSH_CACHE_TTL         = 30    # SSH/SFTP cache TTL for successful results (seconds)
SSH_CACHE_ERROR_TTL   = 300   # SSH/SFTP cache TTL for cached errors (seconds)
ARCHIVE_CACHE_MAX_OPEN = 5    # max archives kept open at once
ARCHIVE_CACHE_TTL      = 300  # archive cache TTL (seconds)
```

## File Monitoring

Automatic reloading of a pane when its directory changes on disk:

```python
FILE_MONITORING_ENABLED                  = True  # enable/disable auto-reload
FILE_MONITORING_COALESCE_DELAY_MS        = 200   # event coalescing window (ms)
FILE_MONITORING_MAX_RELOADS_PER_SECOND   = 5     # rate limit
FILE_MONITORING_FALLBACK_POLL_INTERVAL_S = 5     # polling interval when native events are unavailable (s)
```

See [File Monitoring](FILE_MONITORING_FEATURE.md).

## Backend and Window

The rendering backend is **not** a config option — it is chosen only by the
`--backend` command-line flag (`tui`/`curses`, the default, or `gui`/`macos`). In
desktop mode the window's size and position are remembered automatically across
runs; there are no window-geometry config keys. See
[Desktop Mode Guide](DESKTOP_MODE_GUIDE.md).

## Configuration Examples

### Faster workflow (fewer prompts)

```python
SHOW_HIDDEN_FILES = False
CONFIRM_COPY = False
CONFIRM_MOVE = False
MAX_LOG_MESSAGES = 500
```

### Power user

```python
DATE_FORMAT = 'full'
SHOW_HIDDEN_FILES = True
DEFAULT_LEFT_PANE_RATIO = 0.5
DEFAULT_LOG_HEIGHT_RATIO = 0.3
MAX_LOG_MESSAGES = 2000
PROGRESS_ANIMATION_PATTERN = 'wave'
```

### Desktop appearance (macOS)

```python
MONO_FONT_NAME = 'Menlo'
UI_FONT_NAME   = 'Helvetica Neue'
FONT_SIZE      = 14
TEXT_EDITOR    = 'code'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Changes don't take effect
1. Confirm the file path: `~/.tfm/config.py`
2. Check for Python syntax errors
3. Restart TFM

### TFM fails to start after editing
Likely a syntax error (missing quote/comma/bracket). Restore defaults:

```bash
rm ~/.tfm/config.py   # TFM recreates it from the template on next run
```

### Can't find an option
Check `src/_config.py` — it is the authoritative, fully-commented list of every
available setting.

# Create Directory Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the create directory feature, which allows users to create new directories by pressing the M key when no files are selected.

## Feature Description

**Behavior**: When the M key is pressed without any files or directories selected, the file manager enters "create directory mode" where the user can type a directory name and press Enter to create it.

**Key Bindings**:
- `M` (with no selection): Enter create directory mode
- `M` (with files selected): Move files (existing behavior - unchanged)
- `ESC`: Cancel directory creation
- `Enter`: Create directory with entered name
- `Backspace`: Remove last character from directory name
- `Printable characters`: Add to directory name

## Implementation Details

### State Variables Added

```python
# Create directory mode state
self.create_dir_mode = False      # Whether in create directory mode
self.create_dir_pattern = ""      # Current directory name being typed
```

### Functions Added

1. **`enter_create_directory_mode()`**
   - Checks write permissions for current directory
   - Enters create directory mode
   - Initializes state variables

2. **`exit_create_directory_mode()`**
   - Exits create directory mode
   - Clears state variables
   - Triggers UI redraw

3. **`perform_create_directory()`**
   - Validates directory name
   - Checks for existing directories with same name
   - Creates the directory using `Path.mkdir()`
   - Refreshes file list and moves cursor to new directory
   - Handles errors gracefully

4. **`handle_create_directory_input(key)`**
   - Handles keyboard input during create directory mode
   - Supports ESC (cancel), Enter (create), Backspace (delete), and printable characters

### Functions Modified

1. **`move_selected_files()`**
   - Added check for empty selection at the beginning
   - If no files selected, calls `enter_create_directory_mode()` instead of moving files
   - Maintains backward compatibility for file moving when files are selected

### UI Integration

1. **Status Bar Display**
   - Added create directory mode display in `draw_status_bar()`
   - Shows "Create directory: {pattern}_" with cursor indicator
   - Includes help text "ESC:cancel Enter:create"

2. **Input Loop Integration**
   - Added create directory mode check in main input loop
   - Calls `handle_create_directory_input()` when in create directory mode
   - Prevents other key processing during create directory mode

3. **Help Dialog**
   - Updated help text for M key to indicate dual functionality:
     "m / M            Move files to other pane / Create directory (no selection)"

## User Experience

### Workflow
1. Navigate to desired location in file manager
2. Ensure no files are selected (use Ctrl+A to deselect if needed)
3. Press 'M' key
4. Type desired directory name
5. Press Enter to create or ESC to cancel
6. New directory appears in file list with cursor positioned on it

### Error Handling
- Permission denied: Shows error message if current directory is not writable
- Invalid name: Shows error if directory name is empty or whitespace only
- Existing directory: Shows error if directory with same name already exists
- File system errors: Catches and displays OS-level errors during creation

## Backward Compatibility

The feature maintains complete backward compatibility:
- M key with files selected works exactly as before (moves files)
- All existing move functionality is unchanged
- No changes to configuration or key bindings required
- Existing workflows are not affected

## Testing

Comprehensive tests were implemented:

1. **Unit Tests** (`test_create_directory.py`)
   - Tests all individual functions
   - Verifies state management
   - Tests directory creation functionality

2. **Integration Tests** (`test_create_directory_integration.py`)
   - Tests complete workflow from M key press to directory creation
   - Tests input handling (typing, backspace, enter, escape)
   - Verifies backward compatibility with file moving
   - Tests error conditions

3. **Demo Script** (`demo_create_directory.py`)
   - Demonstrates feature usage and implementation details

## Code Quality

- Follows existing code patterns and style
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Comprehensive logging of operations
- Safe UI drawing with boundary checks
- Memory-efficient state management
- Clear separation of concerns between functions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Directory name validation (invalid characters, length limits)
- Directory templates or quick-create options
- Bulk directory creation
- Integration with file operations (create and immediately enter directory)

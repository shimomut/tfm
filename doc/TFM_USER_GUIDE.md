## Desktop Mode (macOS)

TFM can run as a native macOS desktop application with GPU acceleration, providing a modern windowed experience while maintaining the same keyboard-driven interface.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install PyObjC (one-time setup)
pip install pyobjc-framework-Cocoa

# Run in desktop mode (native macOS window)
python3 tfm.py --backend gui
```

### Features

Desktop mode provides several advantages over terminal mode:

- **Native Window**: Resizable macOS window with standard window controls
- **High-Quality Rendering**: Smooth rendering using CoreGraphics
- **Better Colors**: True RGB color support with accurate color reproduction
- **Font Customization**: Choose your preferred monospace font and size
- **Full-Screen Support**: Native macOS full-screen mode
- **Window Persistence**: Window size and position are remembered

### Configuration

Desktop-mode font settings live in `~/.tfm/config.py` (they are ignored in terminal mode):

```python
# GUI fonts and size — the grid is derived from the monospace face
MONO_FONT_NAME = 'Menlo'   # monospaced face for aligned columns (None = bundled default)
UI_FONT_NAME  = None       # proportional face for names/labels (None = bundled/OS default)
FONT_SIZE     = 12         # point size applied to both faces (8–72)
```

The window's size and position are remembered **automatically** across runs (via
the native macOS window autosave) — there are no window-geometry config keys.

#### Available Fonts

Common monospace fonts on macOS:
- `Menlo` (default) - Apple's default monospace font
- `Monaco` - Classic Mac monospace font
- `SF Mono` - San Francisco Mono (if installed)
- `Courier New` - Traditional monospace font
- `Fira Code` - Popular programming font (if installed)
- `JetBrains Mono` - Modern programming font (if installed)

### Backend Selection

The backend is chosen only by the `--backend` flag; there is no configuration-file
preference. The default is terminal mode:

- `--backend tui` (alias `curses`) — terminal / curses, the default
- `--backend gui` (alias `macos`) — native macOS window (requires PyObjC)

If you request `--backend gui` without PyObjC installed, startup fails with an
error — install it (`pip install pyobjc-framework-Cocoa`) or run in terminal mode.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

All keyboard shortcuts work identically in both terminal and desktop modes. The same key bindings apply regardless of which backend you're using.

For a complete list of all keyboard shortcuts, see the [Keyboard Shortcuts Reference](#keyboard-shortcuts-reference) section. You can also press **?** at any time while using TFM to see the built-in help dialog with all available shortcuts.

### Performance

Desktop mode provides excellent performance:
- **Rendering**: 60 FPS with GPU acceleration
- **Responsiveness**: Immediate input handling
- **Large Directories**: Smooth scrolling even with thousands of files
- **Search Operations**: Non-blocking UI updates

### Troubleshooting Desktop Mode

**Desktop mode doesn't start:**
- Verify you're on macOS (desktop mode is macOS-only)
- Install PyObjC: `pip install pyobjc-framework-Cocoa`
- Check Python version (3.9+ required)

**Window doesn't appear:**
- Check console output for error messages
- Verify PyObjC installation: `python3 -c "import objc; print('OK')"`
- Try terminal mode first to verify TFM works: `python3 tfm.py`

**Font issues:**
- Verify font name is correct (case-sensitive)
- Use `Font Book.app` to check installed fonts
- Fall back to default: Remove `MONO_FONT_NAME` from config (or set it to `None`)

**Performance issues:**
- Desktop mode should run at 60 FPS
- Check Activity Monitor for CPU/GPU usage
- Try reducing window size in configuration

---

## Search and Filtering

### Search Methods
```
F        - Incremental search (filter as you type)
Shift-F  - Threaded filename search dialog
Shift-G  - Content search (grep) dialog
;        - Filter by pattern (*.py, test_*, etc.)
:        - Clear current filter
```

```

### Search Tips
- **Incremental search**: Start typing to filter files immediately
- **Pattern filtering**: Use wildcards like `*.txt` or `test_*`
- **Filename search (Shift-F)**: The query is an *exact* glob matched against the
  whole filename — `report.txt` matches only that name. Add wildcards for partial
  matches: `report*`, `*.py`, or `*report*` for the old "contains" behaviour.
- **Content search**: Search inside files with progress tracking
- **Quick sort**: Use number keys 1-4 for instant sorting
- **ESC**: Cancel any search operation

- Press **Z** → Settings Menu → Edit Configuration
- Or edit `~/.tfm/config.py` directly

**For comprehensive configuration documentation**, see the **[Configuration Feature Guide](CONFIGURATION_FEATURE.md)** which covers all available options, examples, and best practices.

### Key Bindings

TFM supports powerful key binding customization with modifier keys and multiple keys per action:

```python
KEY_BINDINGS = {
    # An action can have several keys — add your own alongside the defaults
    'quit': ['Q'],
    'help': ['?'],

    # e.g. add vim-style movement next to the arrow keys
    'cursor_up': ['UP', 'k'],
    'cursor_down': ['DOWN', 'j'],

    # Modifier key combinations
    'page_up': ['PAGE_UP', 'Shift-UP'],
    'page_down': ['PAGE_DOWN', 'Shift-DOWN'],

    # Extended form with a selection requirement
    'delete_files': {
        'keys': ['K', 'DELETE'],
        'selection': 'required'  # only when files are selected
    },
    'create_directory': {
        'keys': ['M'],
        'selection': 'none'      # only when nothing is selected
    },
}
```

**Key features:**
- **Modifier keys**: Shift, Control, Alt, Command
- **Multiple keys per action**: Assign several keys to the same action
- **Selection requirements**: Control when actions are available
- **Case-insensitive keys**: special key names ('ENTER' = 'enter') and bare letter keys ('q' = 'Q') bind the same physical key; use 'Shift-Q' to bind the shifted variant
- **Order-independent modifiers**: 'Command-Shift-X' = 'Shift-Command-X'

**See detailed documentation**: [Key Bindings Feature](KEY_BINDINGS_FEATURE.md)

### Themes
TFM ships with several built-in themes (Dark+, Light+, Monokai, Dracula, Nord,
Solarized, Gruvbox Dark, Solarized Light) and remembers the last one you used.
Cycle themes at runtime with the **T** key, or pick one from **View → Theme**.
Define your own with the `THEMES` dict in config.

**See detailed documentation**: [Color Schemes Feature](COLOR_SCHEMES_FEATURE.md)

### Favorite Directories
```python
FAVORITE_DIRECTORIES = [
    {'name': 'Projects', 'path': '~/dev'},
    {'name': 'Documents', 'path': '~/Documents'},
    {'name': 'S3 Bucket', 'path': 's3://my-bucket/'},
]
```

**See detailed documentation**: [Navigation Dialogs Feature](NAVIGATION_DIALOGS_FEATURE.md)

### External Programs
```python
PROGRAMS = [
    {'name': 'Git Status', 'command': ['git', 'status']},
    {'name': 'Open in VSCode', 'command': ['code', '.'], 
     'options': {'auto_return': True}},
]
```

**See detailed documentation**: [External Programs Feature](EXTERNAL_PROGRAMS_FEATURE.md)

## Command Line Options

### Basic Usage
```bash
python3 tfm.py                    # Terminal (curses) mode — the default
python3 tfm.py --backend gui      # Native macOS window (requires PyObjC)
python3 tfm.py --left ~/projects  # Set the left pane's startup directory
python3 tfm.py --right ~/docs     # Set the right pane's startup directory
```

### Backend Selection
`--backend` chooses the rendering backend:

```bash
python3 tfm.py --backend tui      # Terminal / curses (alias: --backend curses) — default
python3 tfm.py --backend gui      # Native macOS window (alias: --backend macos)
```

### All Options
```bash
--backend {tui,curses,gui,macos}  # Rendering backend (default: tui)
--left DIR                        # Left pane startup directory
--right DIR                       # Right pane startup directory
--version                         # Show version and exit
--help                            # Show help and exit
```

### Combined Options
```bash
# macOS GUI with custom startup directories
python3 tfm.py --backend gui --left ~/projects --right ~/docs
```

Startup directories set with `--left`/`--right` override any saved pane history for that session; an invalid path falls back to the saved (or home) directory.

> **Letter keys are case-sensitive.** Most file-operation bindings use the
> **uppercase** letter (e.g. `C`, `M`, `K`, `R`), and their variants use `Shift`
> (e.g. `Shift-F`, `Shift-E`). All bindings are customizable — see below.


### Customizing Key Bindings

All key bindings can be customized in your configuration file (`~/.tfm/config.py`). The enhanced key binding system supports:

- **Modifier keys**: Shift, Control, Alt, Command (e.g., 'Shift-UP', 'Command-Q')
- **Multiple keys per action**: Assign several keys to the same action
- **Selection requirements**: Control when actions are available based on file selection
- **Case-insensitive keys**: special key names (`ENTER`) and bare letter keys (`q` = `Q`) bind the same physical key; use `Shift-Q` for the shifted variant

**Examples:**
```python
KEY_BINDINGS = {
    'page_up': ['PAGE_UP', 'Shift-UP'],  # Two ways to page up
    'cursor_up': ['UP', 'k'],            # add a vim-style alternative
    'delete_files': {
        'keys': ['K', 'DELETE'],
        'selection': 'required'          # Only when files selected
    },
}
```

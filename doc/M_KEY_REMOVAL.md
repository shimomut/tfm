# TFM m/M Key File Operations Removal

## Overview

The file operations functionality that was previously mapped to the m/M keys has been completely removed from TFM. This change simplifies the interface and makes the m/M keys available for other potential uses.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Updates

**Files Modified:**
- `src/_config.py`
- `src/tfm_config.py`

**Changes:**
- Removed `'file_operations': ['m', 'M']` from the default key bindings
- The m/M keys are no longer bound to any action by default

### 2. Method Removal

**File Modified:**
- `src/tfm_main.py`

**Changes:**
- Completely removed the `show_file_operations_menu()` method
- This method previously displayed a dialog with options for:
  - Copy
  - Move
  - Delete
  - Rename
  - Properties

### 3. Key Handling Logic Removal

**File Modified:**
- `src/tfm_main.py`

**Changes:**
- Removed the key handling logic that checked for `file_operations` action
- Removed the call to `show_file_operations_menu()` from the main event loop

### 4. Help Text Updates

**File Modified:**
- `src/tfm_main.py`

**Changes:**
- Removed the help text line: `"m / M            File operations menu (copy/move/delete/rename)"`
- The help dialog no longer mentions the m/M keys for file operations

## Impact

### What's Removed
- ❌ File operations menu (copy/move/delete/rename) via m/M keys
- ❌ Quick access to file operations dialog
- ❌ Unified interface for file management operations

### What's Preserved
- ✅ Delete functionality via k/K keys (still available)
- ✅ File viewing via v/V keys
- ✅ File editing via e/E keys
- ✅ All navigation and selection functionality
- ✅ All other TFM features remain intact

### Available Keys
The m/M keys are now **available for other functionality** if needed in the future.

## Verification

A comprehensive test suite verifies the removal:

```bash
# Run the specific verification test
python test/verify_m_key_removal.py

# Or run all quick tests (includes m/M key removal verification)
make test-quick
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Configuration no longer contains `file_operations` binding
- ✅ `show_file_operations_menu` method completely removed
- ✅ Help text no longer mentions m/M file operations
- ✅ Key handling logic for file operations removed
- ✅ No calls to removed functionality remain

## User Impact

### For Existing Users
- **No breaking changes** to core functionality
- Delete operations still work via k/K keys
- File viewing and editing unchanged
- Navigation and selection unchanged

### For New Users
- Simpler interface with fewer key combinations to remember
- More focused on essential file management operations
- Cleaner help documentation

## Future Considerations

The m/M keys are now available for:
- New functionality implementation
- User customization via configuration
- Plugin or extension features

## Technical Notes

### User Configuration Files
Users with existing personal configuration files (`~/.tfm/config.py`) may still have the old key bindings defined. However, since the functionality has been removed from the code, pressing m/M will have no effect even if the keys are still configured.

### Code Cleanup
All related code has been completely removed:
- No dead code remains
- No unused imports
- No orphaned configuration options
- Clean separation of concerns maintained

## Rollback Information

If the file operations menu needs to be restored in the future, the functionality can be found in the git history before this change. The implementation included:

- Quick choice dialog system
- File operation handlers (copy, move, delete, rename, properties)
- Integration with file selection system
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations

## Testing

The removal has been thoroughly tested:

```bash
# Verify removal
make test-quick

# Test core functionality still works
python tfm.py
```

All existing functionality continues to work as expected, with only the m/M file operations menu removed.

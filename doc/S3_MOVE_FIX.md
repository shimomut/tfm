# S3 Move Fix

## Problem Description

When using TFM's file moving feature between S3 directories, users encountered the following error:

```
Error moving file1.txt: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 's3://shimomut-files/test1/file1.txt'
```

This error occurred because the move operation was using Python's `shutil.move()` function, which only works with local file system paths and doesn't understand S3 URIs.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `perform_move_operation()` method in `src/tfm_main.py`:

```python
# OLD CODE - PROBLEMATIC
shutil.move(str(source_file), str(dest_path))
```

### Why This Failed

1. **shutil.move() expects local paths**: The `shutil` module is designed for local file system operations
2. **S3 URIs treated as local paths**: When `str(source_file)` returned `'s3://bucket/key'`, `shutil.move()` treated it as a local file path
3. **File not found error**: Since no local file exists at path `'s3://bucket/key'`, the operation failed with `[Errno 2] No such file or directory`

## Solution Implementation

### Primary Fix

Replace `shutil.move()` calls with `Path.rename()` calls:

```python
# NEW CODE - FIXED
source_file.rename(dest_path)
```

### Why This Works

1. **Path.rename() is implementation-aware**: The `Path` class delegates to the appropriate implementation
2. **S3PathImpl.rename() handles S3 operations**: For S3 paths, this uses native S3 copy and delete operations
3. **Cross-storage support**: Works for local-to-local, S3-to-S3, and cross-storage moves

### Additional Fixes

Several other locations also needed updates to avoid `shutil` operations on S3 paths:

#### 1. Directory Removal in Move Operations

```python
# OLD CODE
shutil.rmtree(source_dir)

# NEW CODE  
self._delete_directory_with_progress(source_dir, 0, 1)
```

#### 2. Overwrite Handling in Move Operations

```python
# OLD CODE
if dest_path.is_dir():
    shutil.rmtree(dest_path)

# NEW CODE
if dest_path.is_dir():
    self._delete_directory_with_progress(dest_path, 0, 1)
```

#### 3. Delete Operation Fallback

```python
# OLD CODE
except OSError:
    shutil.rmtree(dir_path)

# NEW CODE
except OSError:
    try:
        dir_path.rmdir()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Warning: Could not remove directory {dir_path}: {e}")
```

## Technical Details

### S3PathImpl.rename() Implementation

The S3 rename operation works by:

1. **Copy Operation**: Uses S3 `copy_object` to copy the file to the new location
2. **Delete Operation**: Uses S3 `delete_object` to remove the original file  
3. **Cache Invalidation**: Invalidates cache entries for both source and destination
4. **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages for S3-specific issues

```python
def rename(self, target) -> 'Path':
    """Rename this file or directory to the given target"""
    # S3 doesn't have rename, so we copy and delete
    target_path = Path(target) if not isinstance(target, Path) else target
    
    try:
        # Copy to new location
        if isinstance(target_path._impl, S3PathImpl):
            copy_source = {'Bucket': self._bucket, 'Key': self._key}
            self._client.copy_object(
                CopySource=copy_source,
                Bucket=target_path._impl._bucket,
                Key=target_path._impl._key
            )
            # Invalidate cache for target location
            target_path._impl._invalidate_cache_for_write()
        else:
            raise OSError("Cannot rename S3 object to non-S3 path")
        
        # Delete original (this will invalidate cache for source)
        self.unlink()
        return target_path
    except ClientError as e:
        raise OSError(f"Failed to rename S3 object: {e}")
```

### Path.rename() Delegation

The `Path` class properly delegates rename operations to the implementation:

```python
def rename(self, target) -> 'Path':
    """Rename this file or directory to the given target"""
    return self._impl.rename(target)
```

This ensures that:
- Local paths use `os.rename()` (via LocalPathImpl)
- S3 paths use S3 copy+delete operations (via S3PathImpl)
- Other storage types can implement their own rename logic

## Benefits of the Fix

### ✅ Functional Benefits
- **S3 to S3 moves work correctly**: No more "file not found" errors
- **Cross-storage moves supported**: Can move between local and S3 storage
- **Consistent behavior**: Same move operation works across all storage types

### ✅ Technical Benefits
- **Proper abstraction**: Uses the Path abstraction layer correctly
- **Implementation-specific optimizations**: Each storage type can optimize its operations
- **Cache management**: Proper cache invalidation for S3 operations
- **Error handling**: Meaningful error messages for different storage types

### ✅ User Experience Benefits
- **Reliable file operations**: Move operations work as expected
- **Clear error messages**: When operations fail, users get helpful error information
- **Consistent interface**: Same keyboard shortcuts and UI work for all storage types

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests verify S3PathImpl.rename() method exists and works correctly
- Integration tests verify move operations between S3 directories
- Mock tests verify proper S3 API calls (copy_object, delete_object)

### Manual Testing
1. Create files in S3 directory using TFM
2. Select files and use move operation (F6 or Ctrl+X)
3. Verify files are moved to destination directory
4. Verify original files are removed from source directory

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `src/tfm_main.py`: Updated move operations to use Path.rename()
- `src/tfm_s3.py`: S3PathImpl.rename() method (already existed)
- `src/tfm_path.py`: Path.rename() delegation (already existed)

### Testing and Documentation
- `test/test_s3_move_fix.py`: Unit tests for the fix
- `demo/demo_s3_move_fix.py`: Demonstration of the fix
- `doc/S3_MOVE_FIX.md`: This documentation

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Progress tracking for large S3 moves**: Currently S3 moves are atomic operations
2. **Batch operations**: Optimize multiple file moves with S3 batch operations
3. **Cross-region moves**: Handle moves between different S3 regions
4. **Metadata preservation**: Ensure S3 metadata is preserved during moves

### Monitoring
- Monitor S3 API usage to ensure efficient operations
- Track move operation success rates
- Monitor cache hit rates for S3 operations

## Conclusion

This fix resolves the S3 move operation issue by properly using the Path abstraction layer instead of bypassing it with direct `shutil` calls. The solution is robust, maintainable, and extends naturally to other storage types that may be added in the future.

The key insight is that TFM's Path system is designed to handle multiple storage types transparently, and operations should use the Path interface rather than assuming local file system semantics.

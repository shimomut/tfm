# Log Redraw Trigger Feature

## Overview

TFM automatically updates the log display whenever new messages appear. This means you see file operations, error messages, and system status updates immediately without needing to press any keys or refresh the display.

## How It Works

When TFM performs operations like copying files or encounters errors, the log messages appear instantly in the log pane at the bottom of the screen. You don't need to do anything - the display updates automatically.



## What You'll See

### File Operations
When you copy, move, or delete files, you'll see messages like:
- "Copying file: document.txt"
- "Copy completed successfully"
- "File moved to destination"

### Error Messages
If something goes wrong, error messages appear immediately:
- "Error: Permission denied"
- "File not found"
- "Disk space full"

### System Status
Configuration changes and system events show up right away:
- "Configuration loaded"
- "Color scheme changed"
- "Remote log server started"

## Benefits

### Real-Time Feedback
- **File Operations**: See progress and completion messages instantly
- **Error Messages**: Errors appear as soon as they happen
- **System Status**: Configuration changes are immediately visible

### Better User Experience
- **No Manual Refresh**: You don't need to press keys to see updates
- **Immediate Response**: Operations provide instant visual feedback
- **Live Status**: Always see what's currently happening

## No Configuration Needed

This feature works automatically - there's nothing you need to set up or configure. It works with:
- All existing log messages
- Remote log monitoring (if you use it)
- All color schemes
- All file operations

## Performance

The feature is designed to be efficient:
- Only updates the display when there are actually new messages
- No impact on TFM's performance
- Works smoothly even with many log messages

## Summary

The log redraw trigger feature makes TFM feel more responsive by showing you what's happening in real-time. You'll see file operations, errors, and system messages immediately without needing to do anything special.

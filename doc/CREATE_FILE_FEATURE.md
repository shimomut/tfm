# Create File Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the create file feature, which allows users to create new empty text files by pressing Shift-E and automatically opens them in the configured text editor.

## Feature Description

**Behavior**: When Shift-E is pressed, the file manager enters "create file mode" where the user can type a filename and press Enter to create an empty file and immediately open it in the text editor.

**Key Bindings**:
- `e`: Edit existing file (unchanged behavior)
- `E` (Shift-E): Create new text file and edit
- `ESC`: Cancel file creation
- `Enter`: Create file and open in editor
- `Backspace`: Remove last character from filename
- `Printable characters`: Add to filename

## Implementation Details

### State Variables Added

```python
# Create file mode state
self.create_file_mode = False      # Whether in create file mode
self.create_file_pattern = ""      # Current filename being typed
```

### Functions Added

1. **`enter_create_file_mode()`**
   - Checks write permissions for current directory
   - Enters create file mode
   - Initializes state variables

2. **`exit_create_file_mode()`**
   - Exits create file mode
   - Clears state variables
   - Triggers UI redraw

3. **`perform_create_file()`**
   - Validates filename
   - Checks for existing files with same name
   - Creates empty file using `Path.touch()`
   - Refreshes file list and moves cursor to new file
   - Automatically launches text editor
   - Handles errors gracefully

4. **`handle_create_file_input(key)`**
   - Handles keyboard input during create file mode
   - Supports ESC (cancel), Enter (create), Backspace (delete), and printable characters

### Key Handling Modified

**Previous behavior**: Both 'e' and 'E' were bound to the same `edit_file` action

**New behavior**:
- `e` key: Calls `edit_selected_file()` directly (edit existing file)
- `E` key: Calls `enter_create_file_mode()` (create new file)

This change provides distinct functionality while maintaining backward compatibility.

### UI Integration

1. **Status Bar Display**
   - Added create file mode display in `draw_status_bar()`
   - Shows "Create file: {pattern}_" with cursor indicator
   - Includes help text "ESC:cancel Enter:create"

2. **Input Loop Integration**
   - Added create file mode check in main input loop
   - Calls `handle_create_file_input()` when in create file mode
   - Prevents other key processing during create file mode

3. **Help Dialog**
   - Updated help text to distinguish between e and E keys:
     - "e                Edit existing file with text editor"
     - "E                Create new text file and edit"

## User Experience

### Workflow
1. Navigate to desired location in file manager
2. Press 'Shift-E' (E key)
3. Type desired filename (with extension if needed)
4. Press Enter to create and edit, or ESC to cancel
5. Empty file is created and text editor opens automatically
6. After editing and saving, return to file manager
7. New file appears in file list with cursor positioned on it

### Automatic Editor Launch
- After creating the file, the text editor is automatically launched
- Uses the same editor configuration as the existing edit functionality
- Provides seamless workflow from creation to editing

### Error Handling
- **Permission denied**: Shows error message if current directory is not writable
- **Invalid name**: Shows error if filename is empty or whitespace only
- **Existing file**: Shows error if file with same name already exists
- **Editor errors**: Handles text editor launch failures gracefully
- **File system errors**: Catches and displays OS-level errors during creation

## Backward Compatibility

The feature maintains complete backward compatibility:
- `e` key behavior unchanged (edits existing files)
- All existing edit functionality preserved
- No changes to configuration required
- Existing workflows not affected
- Same text editor configuration used

## Testing

Comprehensive tests were implemented:

1. **Unit Tests** (`test_create_file.py`)
   - Tests all individual functions
   - Verifies state management
   - Tests file creation functionality
   - Mocks editor launch to avoid external dependencies

2. **Integration Tests** (`test_create_file_integration.py`)
   - Tests complete workflow from Shift-E press to file creation
   - Tests input handling (typing, backspace, enter, escape)
   - Verifies backward compatibility with existing edit functionality
   - Tests error conditions and edge cases

3. **Demo Script** (`demo_create_file.py`)
   - Demonstrates feature usage and implementation details
   - Documents user experience and technical aspects

## Code Quality

- Follows existing code patterns and style
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Comprehensive logging of operations
- Safe UI drawing with boundary checks
- Memory-efficient state management
- Clear separation of concerns between functions
- Consistent with existing file operations

## Technical Details

### File Creation Process
1. Validate filename (non-empty, valid characters)
2. Check if file already exists
3. Create empty file using `Path.touch()`
4. Refresh file list to include new file
5. Position cursor on newly created file
6. Launch text editor automatically
7. Handle any errors that occur during the process

### Editor Integration
- Uses same `edit_selected_file()` function as existing edit functionality
- Respects user's configured text editor
- Handles editor launch errors gracefully
- Suspends and resumes curses properly during editor session

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- File templates (e.g., create Python file with basic structure)
- File extension auto-completion or suggestions
- Integration with project-specific file templates
- Option to create file without immediately opening editor
- Bulk file creation capabilities

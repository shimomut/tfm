# TFM S3 Fixes and Optimizations

## Overview

This document consolidates all the fixes and optimizations implemented for TFM's S3 support system. These improvements address various issues encountered during S3 operations and provide significant performance enhancements.

## Cache System Fixes

### S3 Cache Key Consistency Fix

**Problem**: `get_file_info()` calls were not hitting the cache and causing 404 errors from HeadObject API calls during directory rendering.

**Root Cause**: Cache keys used during `iterdir()` (when caching stat information) didn't match the cache keys used during `stat()` calls (when retrieving file information).

**Solution**: 
- Added `cache_key_override` parameter to `_cached_api_call()` method
- Ensured consistent cache key usage between directory listing and stat operations
- Proactive caching of stat information during directory listing

**Benefits**:
- **API Call Reduction**: 100% for cached files
- **Error Elimination**: 0 404 errors for valid files
- **Performance**: Significantly faster directory operations
- **Reliability**: Consistent file information display

### S3 Caching Performance Optimization

**Problem**: N+1 API call problem causing slow directory rendering (1 `list_objects_v2` call + N `head_object` calls for N files).

**Solution**: 
- Cache file stat information during directory listing
- Use cached metadata from `list_objects_v2` response for subsequent `stat()` calls
- Optimize virtual directory stats to use cached data

**Performance Improvements**:

| Scenario | Before | After | Improvement |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Directory with 20 files | 21 calls | 1 call | 95% reduction |
| Directory with 100 files | 101 calls | 1 call | 99% reduction |
| Repeated directory access | N+1 calls | 0 calls | 100% reduction |

### S3 Cache TTL Configuration

**Enhancement**: Made S3 cache TTL configurable through TFM configuration system.

**Configuration**:
```python
class Config:
    S3_CACHE_TTL = 120  # Cache for 2 minutes (default: 60)
```

**Recommended TTL Values**:
- **30 seconds**: Very fresh data, more API calls
- **60 seconds**: Default, good balance
- **120 seconds**: Less API calls, slightly stale data
- **300 seconds**: Good for stable directories
- **600 seconds**: Minimal API calls, longer staleness

### S3 Cache Invalidation Feature

**Enhancement**: Automatic cache invalidation after file and archive operations.

**Invalidation Strategies**:
- **Copy Operations**: Invalidate destination directory cache
- **Move Operations**: Invalidate both source and destination caches
- **Delete Operations**: Invalidate parent directory cache
- **Archive Operations**: Invalidate archive and source/destination paths
- **Create Operations**: Invalidate created path and parent directory

**Benefits**:
- Users always see current state of S3 directories
- No need to manually refresh or wait for cache expiration
- Transparent operation with error resilience

## Navigation and Path Fixes

### S3 Backspace Navigation Fix

**Problem**: Backspace key would not work correctly when browsing S3 buckets, particularly for paths ending with trailing slashes.

**Root Cause**: The `parent` property didn't properly handle S3 keys ending with trailing slashes (e.g., `s3://bucket/folder/`).

**Solution**:
```python
@property
def parent(self) -> 'Path':
    # Strip trailing slash to handle directory keys properly
    key_without_trailing_slash = self._key.rstrip('/')
    
    if '/' not in key_without_trailing_slash:
        return Path(f's3://{self._bucket}/')
    
    parent_key = '/'.join(key_without_trailing_slash.split('/')[:-1])
    if parent_key:
        return Path(f's3://{self._bucket}/{parent_key}/')
    else:
        return Path(f's3://{self._bucket}/')
```

**Benefits**:
- Backspace key works consistently for all S3 path formats
- Seamless parent directory navigation in S3 buckets
- S3 buckets correctly treated as root directories

### S3 Empty Names Fix

**Problem**: Directories were appearing with empty names and showing as "0B" in size.

**Root Cause**: When S3 directory keys end with a forward slash (e.g., `test1/`), the `name` property would return an empty string.

**Solution**:
```python
@property
def name(self) -> str:
    # Strip trailing slash before splitting to handle directory keys properly
    key_without_slash = self._key.rstrip('/')
    return key_without_slash.split('/')[-1] if '/' in key_without_slash else key_without_slash
```

**Benefits**:
- S3 directories now show proper names in TFM file browser
- Consistent naming across all S3 path formats

## File Operation Fixes

### S3 Copy Fix

**Problem**: Copying files from local filesystem to S3 resulted in "Permission denied" errors.

**Root Cause**: TFM was using `shutil.copy2()` for all copy operations, which only works with local filesystem paths.

**Solution**: 
- Added new `copy_to()` method to Path class
- Implemented cross-storage copy logic
- Automatic storage type detection

**Cross-Storage Copy Support**:
- **Local to Local**: Uses `shutil.copy2()` for optimal performance
- **Local to S3**: Reads file content and uploads using `write_bytes()`
- **S3 to Local**: Downloads using `read_bytes()` and writes locally
- **S3 to S3**: Downloads from source and uploads to destination

### S3 Move Fix

**Problem**: Moving files between S3 directories resulted in "No such file or directory" errors.

**Root Cause**: Move operations were using `shutil.move()` which doesn't understand S3 URIs.

**Solution**: 
- Replace `shutil.move()` calls with `Path.rename()` calls
- Updated directory removal logic to use Path methods
- Enhanced error handling for S3-specific issues

**Benefits**:
- S3 to S3 moves work correctly
- Cross-storage moves supported
- Consistent behavior across all storage types

### S3 Directory Deletion Fix

**Problem**: Attempting to delete S3 directories resulted in "No files to delete" error.

**Root Cause**: 
1. `exists()` method only checked for actual S3 objects, not virtual directories
2. Lack of recursive deletion support for S3 paths

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `exists()` method to check for virtual directories
- Added `rmtree()` method for recursive S3 directory deletion
- Added `_delete_objects_batch()` for efficient batch deletion
- Enhanced TFM directory deletion logic for S3 paths

**Benefits**:
- Fixed "No files to delete" error for S3 directories
- Recursive deletion support with progress tracking
- Efficient batch deletion using S3's batch delete API

## Virtual Directory Optimizations

### S3 Virtual Directory Optimization

**Problem**: Virtual directories (directories without actual S3 objects) caused HeadObject failures and unnecessary API calls.

**Solution**: Store metadata as S3PathImpl instance properties to eliminate API calls.

**Implementation**:
```python
def __init__(self, s3_uri: str, metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None):
    self._metadata = metadata or {}
    self._is_dir_cached = self._metadata.get('is_dir')
    self._is_file_cached = self._metadata.get('is_file')
    self._size_cached = self._metadata.get('size')
    self._mtime_cached = self._metadata.get('last_modified')
```

**Performance Improvements**:

| Operation | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| `is_dir()` on virtual directory | 1 API call | 0 API calls | 100% reduction |
| `is_file()` on cached file | 1 API call | 0 API calls | 100% reduction |
| `stat()` on cached object | 1 API call | 0 API calls | 100% reduction |
| Directory with 20 items | 20+ API calls | 0 API calls | 100% reduction |

**Benefits**:
- Sub-microsecond response times for cached operations
- Elimination of 404 errors for virtual directories
- Significant performance improvement for large directories

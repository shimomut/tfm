# H Key Unassignment from Help Dialog Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of removing the 'h' key from the help dialog binding, leaving only the '?' key for accessing help in the TFM (Terminal File Manager).

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Files Updated

**File: `src/_config.py`**
- Changed `'help': ['?', 'h']` to `'help': ['?']` in the KEY_BINDINGS dictionary

**File: `src/tfm_config.py`**
- Changed `'help': ['?', 'h']` to `'help': ['?']` in the DefaultConfig.KEY_BINDINGS dictionary

**File: `~/.tfm/config.py` (User Configuration)**
- Updated user's personal configuration file to remove 'h' from help binding

### 2. Documentation Updated

**File: `README.md`**
- Updated key binding table: `| '? / h' | Show help dialog |` → `| '?' | Show help dialog |`

**File: `doc/HELP_DIALOG_FEATURE.md`**
- Updated configuration example: `'help': ['?', 'h'],  # Both ? and h keys show help` → `'help': ['?'],  # ? key shows help`

**File: `doc/CONFIGURATION_SYSTEM.md`**
- Updated key bindings example: `'help': ['?', 'h'],` → `'help': ['?'],`

**File: `doc/HELP_DIALOG_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`**
- Updated configuration example: `'help': ['?', 'h'],  # Both keys show help dialog` → `'help': ['?'],  # ? key shows help dialog`

**File: `DOT_KEY_HIDDEN_TOGGLE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**
- Updated usage instructions to remove reference to 'h' key for help

### 3. Test Files Created

**File: `test_h_key_unassigned.py`**
- Test script to verify the 'h' key is no longer bound to the help action
- Verifies that the '?' key is still bound to help
- Confirms only '?' is in the help key bindings list

## Functionality

### Before
- **Keys**: '?' and 'h' (both keys opened help dialog)
- **Action**: Show help dialog

### After
- **Key**: '?' only
- **Action**: Show help dialog

## Rationale for the Change

1. **Key Availability**: Frees up the 'h' key for potential future use
2. **Simplification**: Reduces redundancy - one key for help is sufficient
3. **Convention**: The '?' key is the more conventional help key in terminal applications
4. **Consistency**: Aligns with common terminal application patterns

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Key Mapping**: Eliminates duplicate key bindings
2. **Available Key**: The 'h' key is now available for other functions
3. **Standard Convention**: Using only '?' follows common terminal app conventions
4. **Reduced Confusion**: Users only need to remember one key for help

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:

1. **Configuration Loading**: Verified that the new key binding is loaded correctly
2. **Key Binding Logic**: Confirmed that only '?' is bound to help action
3. **Functionality**: Verified that 'h' is no longer recognized as help key
4. **Documentation Consistency**: All help text and documentation updated

## Usage

After this implementation:

1. Press `?` to open the help dialog
2. The 'h' key is now unassigned and available for future use
3. All documentation reflects only the '?' key for help

## Backward Compatibility

- The 'h' key binding for help is completely removed
- Users with custom configurations will need to update their `~/.tfm/config.py` file
- The '?' key continues to work as before
- All documentation updated to reflect the single key binding

## Files Modified

- `src/_config.py`
- `src/tfm_config.py`
- `README.md`
- `doc/HELP_DIALOG_FEATURE.md`
- `doc/CONFIGURATION_SYSTEM.md`
- `doc/HELP_DIALOG_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `DOT_KEY_HIDDEN_TOGGLE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `~/.tfm/config.py` (user configuration)

## Files Created

- `test_h_key_unassigned.py`
- `H_KEY_UNASSIGNMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (this document)

## Future Considerations

With the 'h' key now available, it could potentially be used for:
- A new feature or command
- Alternative navigation
- Quick access to a frequently used function

The key is now free for assignment to any future functionality without conflicting with the help system.

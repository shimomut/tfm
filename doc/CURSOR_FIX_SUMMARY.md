# SingleLineTextEdit Cursor Rendering Fix

## Issue Description

When editing text longer than the maximum display width, the cursor would stop rendering in certain situations, particularly when the cursor was at the end of the text. This made it difficult for users to see where they were typing.

## Root Causes

### 1. Boundary Condition in Cursor Rendering
The original code had this condition for rendering the end-of-text cursor:
```python
if cursor_in_visible >= len(visible_text) and is_active and current_x < x + max_width:
```

**Problem**: When text filled the entire available width, `current_x` would equal `x + max_width`, causing the condition to fail and the cursor not to render.

### 2. Visible Window Calculation
The visible window calculation didn't properly account for the cursor needing space when positioned at the end of text, leading to situations where the cursor position was calculated to be outside the visible area.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Visible Window Calculation
```python
# Reserve space for cursor if it's at the end of text
effective_max_width = text_max_width
if cursor_pos == len(self.text) and text_max_width > 1:
    effective_max_width = text_max_width - 1  # Reserve space for end cursor
```

This ensures that when the cursor is at the end of text, we reserve one character space for cursor rendering.

### 2. Enhanced Cursor Rendering Logic
```python
# If cursor is at the end of text and field is active, show cursor after last character
if cursor_in_visible >= len(visible_text) and is_active:
    # Make sure we have space to draw the cursor
    if current_x < x + max_width:
        self._safe_addstr(stdscr, y, current_x, " ", base_color | curses.A_REVERSE)
    elif len(visible_text) > 0 and current_x == x + max_width:
        # If we're at the edge, replace the last character with cursor
        last_char_x = current_x - 1
        last_char = visible_text[-1] if visible_text else " "
        self._safe_addstr(stdscr, y, last_char_x, last_char, base_color | curses.A_REVERSE)
```

This provides two fallback mechanisms:
1. **Primary**: Draw cursor in available space
2. **Fallback**: If no space available, highlight the last character as the cursor

## Test Cases Covered

### Edge Cases Now Working
- ✅ Cursor at end of long text
- ✅ Text exactly filling display width
- ✅ Very narrow displays
- ✅ Empty text fields
- ✅ Single character text
- ✅ Cursor at various positions in long text

### Scenarios Tested
1. **Short text, cursor at end**: `hello.txt|` (cursor after text)
2. **Long text, cursor at end**: `...display_width.txt|` (scrolled view)
3. **Long text, cursor in middle**: `...that_e[x]ceeds_dis...` (cursor on character)
4. **Text fills exactly**: `exact_width_file.tx[t]` (cursor on last char)
5. **Very narrow display**: `F: me.tx[t]` (heavily constrained)

## Benefits

### User Experience
- ✅ Cursor always visible when editing
- ✅ Clear indication of insertion point
- ✅ Consistent behavior across different text lengths
- ✅ Works well in narrow terminals

### Technical
- ✅ Backward compatible - no API changes
- ✅ Handles all edge cases gracefully
- ✅ Efficient - minimal performance impact
- ✅ Robust - works with various terminal sizes

## Before vs After

### Before (Broken)
```
Long text: "very_long_filename_that_exceeds_display_width.txt"
Display:   "eds_display_width.txt"  <- No cursor visible!
Cursor at position 49 (end of text)
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Long text: "very_long_filename_that_exceeds_display_width.txt"
Display:   "eds_display_width.txt "  <- Cursor visible as space
           OR
Display:   "eds_display_width.tx[t]" <- Cursor on last char if no space
Cursor at position 49 (end of text)
```

## Integration

The fix integrates seamlessly with the GeneralPurposeDialog improvements:
- Works with the improved width calculations
- Handles narrow terminals gracefully
- Maintains cursor visibility in all dialog scenarios
- No conflicts with help text positioning

## Validation

All tests pass:
- ✅ Original SingleLineTextEdit functionality preserved
- ✅ New cursor rendering scenarios work correctly
- ✅ GeneralPurposeDialog integration works
- ✅ Edge cases handled properly
- ✅ No regressions in existing features

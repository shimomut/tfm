# Progress System Generalization - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully generalized the TFM status bar progress updating feature from archive-specific to a unified system supporting multiple file operations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Progress Manager Module (`src/tfm_progress_manager.py`)

- **ProgressManager Class**: Central class for tracking operation progress
- **OperationType Enum**: Defines supported operation types (COPY, MOVE, DELETE, ARCHIVE_CREATE, ARCHIVE_EXTRACT)
- **Flexible Progress Tracking**: Supports custom descriptions, error counting, and progress callbacks
- **Smart Text Formatting**: Automatically formats progress text to fit available screen width

### 2. Integration with Main TFM Class

- **Unified Progress Display**: Status bar now shows progress for any active operation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy archive progress system still supported
- **Progress Callback**: `_progress_callback()` method handles screen refreshes
- **Operation Integration**: All file operations now use the generalized progress system

### 3. Updated File Operations

#### Copy Operations (`perform_copy_operation`)
- Progress tracking for multi-file copy operations
- Real-time display of current file being copied
- Error counting and reporting

#### Move Operations (`perform_move_operation`)
- Progress tracking for multi-file move operations
- Handles symbolic links, directories, and regular files
- Error tracking with progress updates

#### Delete Operations (`perform_delete_operation`)
- Progress tracking for multi-file delete operations
- Real-time display of files being deleted
- Error handling with progress feedback

#### Archive Operations
- **ZIP Creation**: Updated to use new progress system
- **TAR.GZ Creation**: Updated to use new progress system
- **Complete Migration**: Legacy `archive_progress` system fully migrated to new ProgressManager

### 4. Smart Progress Display Logic

- **Threshold-Based**: Only shows progress for operations with multiple files (> 1)
- **Dynamic Formatting**: Adjusts display based on available screen width
- **Priority System**: Progress display takes precedence over other status information
- **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to legacy archive progress if new system unavailable

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Complete test suite in `test/test_progress_manager.py`
- **Demo Script**: Interactive demonstration in `tools/demo_progress.py`
- **All Tests Pass**: Verified functionality across all operation types

### 6. Documentation

- **Technical Documentation**: Detailed documentation in `doc/PROGRESS_SYSTEM.md`
- **README Updates**: Added progress tracking to feature list
- **Code Comments**: Comprehensive inline documentation

## Key Features

### Real-Time Progress Updates
- Shows current file being processed
- Displays progress count (e.g., "15/50")
- Shows percentage complete
- Updates in real-time during operations

### Error Tracking
- Counts errors during operations
- Maintains progress display even when errors occur
- Reports final error count after completion

### Flexible Display
- Automatically truncates long filenames to fit screen
- Adapts to different terminal widths
- Shows operation type and optional description
- Example: `Copying (to Documents)... 15/50 (30%) - large_file.pdf`

### Operation Support
- **Copy**: `Copying... 5/10 (50%) - document.pdf`
- **Move**: `Moving (to Archive)... 3/8 (37%) - image.jpg`
- **Delete**: `Deleting... 2/5 (40%) - temp_file.tmp`
- **Archive Create**: `Creating archive (ZIP: backup.zip)... 12/25 (48%) - data.csv`

## Benefits

1. **Unified Experience**: Consistent progress display across all file operations
2. **Better User Feedback**: Users can see progress for long-running operations
3. **Error Visibility**: Clear indication when errors occur during operations
4. **Maintainable Code**: Single progress system instead of operation-specific implementations
5. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add progress tracking to new operations
6. **Backward Compatible**: Existing archive progress functionality preserved

## Usage Example

```python
# Start tracking a copy operation
self.progress_manager.start_operation(
    OperationType.COPY, 
    len(files_to_copy), 
    f"to {destination.name}",
    self._progress_callback
)

# Update progress for each file
for i, file_path in enumerate(files_to_copy):
    self.progress_manager.update_progress(file_path.name, i)
    # ... perform actual copy operation ...
    
# Always finish tracking
self.progress_manager.finish_operation()
```

## Future Enhancements

The new system provides a foundation for additional features:
- Estimated time remaining calculations
- Transfer speed display (files/sec, MB/sec)
- Pause/resume functionality for long operations
- Background operation support
- Operation history and logging

## Testing

All functionality verified through:
- ✅ Unit tests for ProgressManager class
- ✅ Integration tests with file operations
- ✅ Interactive demo showing real-time progress
- ✅ Backward compatibility verification
- ✅ Error handling validation

The generalized progress system successfully replaces the archive-specific implementation while maintaining all existing functionality and adding comprehensive progress tracking for all file operations.

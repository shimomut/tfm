# Cursor Position History Implementation

## Overview
Implemented cursor position history for both left and right file lists in TFM. The system stores the filename of the cursor position historically up to 100 entries separately for each pane. When changing directories, the system checks for previous filename the cursor was on and restores the cursor position.

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure Changes
- Added `cursor_history` field to both `left_pane` and `right_pane` dictionaries
- Uses `collections.deque` with `maxlen=100` to automatically limit history size
- Stores tuples of `(filename, directory_path)` for each cursor position

### New Methods Added

#### `save_cursor_position(self, pane_data)`
- Saves the current cursor position to history before changing directories
- Stores the currently selected filename and directory path
- Removes any existing entry for the current directory to avoid duplicates
- Automatically maintains the 100-entry limit via deque

#### `restore_cursor_position(self, pane_data)`
- Attempts to restore cursor position when entering a directory
- Searches history in reverse order (most recent first) for matching directory
- If found, locates the filename in current file list and sets cursor position
- Adjusts scroll offset to keep restored selection visible
- Returns `True` if restoration successful, `False` otherwise

### Integration Points

#### Directory Navigation (Enter Key)
- Modified `handle_enter()` method to save cursor position before entering directories
- Added cursor restoration after refreshing file list
- Falls back to first item if no history found

#### Parent Directory Navigation
- Updated backspace key handler to save/restore cursor positions
- Updated left arrow (left pane) and right arrow (right pane) parent navigation
- All parent navigation methods now preserve cursor history

#### Pane Synchronization
- Updated `sync_pane_directories()` to save/restore cursor positions
- Updated `sync_other_pane_directory()` to save/restore cursor positions
- Maintains separate history for each pane

## Usage
The feature works automatically and transparently:

1. **Navigate into directory**: Cursor position is saved, and if you return to this directory later, cursor will be restored to the same file
2. **Navigate to parent**: Cursor position is saved, and when returning to child directory, cursor is restored
3. **Pane synchronization**: Each pane maintains its own cursor history independently
4. **History limit**: Automatically maintains up to 100 cursor positions per pane

## Benefits
- Improves navigation efficiency by remembering where you were in each directory
- Separate history for left and right panes allows independent navigation patterns
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory bloat with 100-entry limit
- Seamless integration with existing navigation methods

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite to verify functionality
- Tests cover basic save/restore operations
- Integration tests verify proper interaction with existing TFM methods
- All tests pass successfully

## Files Modified
- `src/tfm_main.py`: Main implementation of cursor history functionality

## Files Added
- `test_cursor_history.py`: Basic functionality test
- `test_cursor_integration.py`: Integration test with TFM methods
- `CURSOR_POSITION_HISTORY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`: This documentation

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The cursor position history will enhance the user experience by making directory navigation more intuitive and efficient.

# Help Dialog (? Key)

TFM includes a scrollable help dialog listing every key binding and usage tip.
Press **?** from anywhere in TFM to open it — no special mode or prerequisite.

## Usage

- **?** — open the help dialog
- **↑/↓** — scroll line by line
- **Page Up/Down** — scroll by page
- **Home/End** — jump to top/bottom
- **Escape** or **q** — close

## Content

The help is generated from your current key bindings, so it always reflects your
configuration (including any customizations). It is organized into sections:

- **Navigation** — arrow keys, pane switching, directory navigation
- **File Operations** — selection (Space), bulk selection (A, Shift-A), copy
  (C), move (M), delete (K), rename (R), view (V), edit (E), details (I)
- **Search & Sorting** — search (F incremental, Shift-F filename, Shift-G
  content) and sort options (S, 1–4)
- **View Options** — hidden files (.), pane sync (O, Shift-O), layout
- **Log Pane** — resize (bracket keys) and scroll (Shift+Up/Down)
- **General** — help (?), quit (Q), cancel (ESC)
- **Configuration** — where config lives and tips for customizing it

## Configuration

Help is bound to **?** by default. Rebind the `help` action in `KEY_BINDINGS`
to use a different key:

```python
KEY_BINDINGS = {
    'help': ['?'],  # ? shows help
    # ... other bindings
}
```

## About dialog

Separate from the help dialog, the **About** dialog shows TFM's logo, version
number, and GitHub repository URL over an animated Matrix-style background
(falling full-width green katakana). Open it from the menu bar in desktop mode:

- **macOS**: TFM → About TFM
- **Other platforms**: Help → About TFM

Close it by pressing any key, clicking, or pressing ESC. The animation runs
while the dialog is open and adapts to window resizing.

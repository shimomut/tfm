# TFM Navigation System

## Overview

The TFM Navigation System handles directory traversal, cursor positioning, and navigation state management. This document covers the implementation details of navigation behaviors and optimizations.

## Core Navigation Components

### Directory Navigation
- **Enter Key**: Navigate into directories
- **Backspace Key**: Navigate to parent directory with intelligent cursor positioning
- **Path Resolution**: Cross-platform path handling with TFMPath abstraction

### Cursor Management
- **Position Memory**: Maintains cursor positions across directory changes
- **Scroll Adjustment**: Ensures selected items remain visible
- **History Integration**: Fallback to saved cursor positions

## Parent Directory Cursor Positioning

### Implementation Details

When navigating from a child directory to its parent directory using the Backspace key, the system implements intelligent cursor positioning to improve user experience.

#### Key Changes in `src/tfm_main.py`

```python
elif key == curses.KEY_BACKSPACE or key == KEY_BACKSPACE_2 or key == KEY_BACKSPACE_1:  # Backspace - go to parent directory
    if current_pane['path'] != current_pane['path'].parent:
        try:
            # Save current cursor position before changing directory
            self.save_cursor_position(current_pane)
            
            # Remember the child directory name we're leaving
            child_directory_name = current_pane['path'].name
            
            current_pane['path'] = current_pane['path'].parent
            current_pane['selected_index'] = 0
            current_pane['scroll_offset'] = 0
            current_pane['selected_files'].clear()  # Clear selections when changing directory
            self.refresh_files(current_pane)
            
            # Try to set cursor to the child directory we just came from
            cursor_set = False
            for i, file_path in enumerate(current_pane['files']):
                if file_path.name == child_directory_name and file_path.is_dir():
                    current_pane['selected_index'] = i
                    # Adjust scroll offset to keep selection visible
                    self.adjust_scroll_for_selection(current_pane)
                    cursor_set = True
                    break
            
            # If we couldn't find the child directory, try to restore cursor position from history
            if not cursor_set and not self.restore_cursor_position(current_pane):
                # If no history found, default to first item
                current_pane['selected_index'] = 0
                current_pane['scroll_offset'] = 0
            
            self.needs_full_redraw = True
        except PermissionError:
            self.show_error("Permission denied")
            self.needs_full_redraw = True
```

#### Behavior Flow

1. **User presses Backspace** while in a child directory
2. **System remembers** the current directory name (`child_directory_name`)
3. **Navigation occurs** to the parent directory
4. **Files are refreshed** in the parent directory
5. **Cursor positioning logic**:
   - First, try to find the child directory we came from
   - If found, position cursor on that directory
   - If not found (e.g., directory was deleted), fall back to cursor history
   - If no history available, default to first item
6. **Scroll adjustment** ensures the selected directory is visible

#### Fallback Mechanisms

The implementation includes robust fallback mechanisms:

1. **Primary**: Position cursor on child directory we came from
2. **Secondary**: Restore cursor position from saved history
3. **Tertiary**: Default to first item (index 0)

### Edge Cases Handled

#### 1. Child Directory No Longer Exists
If the child directory is deleted while the user is in it, the fallback mechanisms ensure graceful handling:
- Attempts to find the child directory (fails)
- Falls back to cursor history restoration
- If no history, defaults to first item

#### 2. Root Directory Navigation
When already at the root directory, the condition `current_pane['path'] != current_pane['path'].parent` prevents unnecessary processing.

#### 3. Permission Errors
Permission errors during navigation are caught and displayed to the user with appropriate error messages.

#### 4. Scroll Adjustment
The `adjust_scroll_for_selection()` method ensures that when the cursor is positioned on the child directory, it remains visible even if it's outside the current scroll view.

## Navigation State Management

### Cursor History System
- **Position Saving**: `save_cursor_position(current_pane)` stores cursor state before navigation
- **Position Restoration**: `restore_cursor_position(current_pane)` retrieves saved positions
- **History Limits**: Uses `MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES` configuration for memory management

### Scroll Management
- **Automatic Adjustment**: `adjust_scroll_for_selection(current_pane)` keeps selections visible
- **Offset Calculation**: Maintains proper scroll offset during navigation
- **Viewport Management**: Ensures selected items remain within visible area

## Performance Considerations

### Minimal Overhead
- Single directory name string storage (minimal memory impact)
- Linear search through parent directory files (typically small lists)
- No additional file system operations beyond normal navigation

### Optimization
- Early termination when child directory is found
- Efficient fallback chain prevents unnecessary operations
- Reuses existing scroll adjustment and cursor positioning logic

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Storage Support
- Works with all supported storage types (local filesystem, S3, etc.)
- Uses TFMPath abstraction for cross-platform compatibility
- Handles different path separators and naming conventions

### Path Handling
- **Name Extraction**: Uses `current_pane['path'].name` for cross-platform directory name extraction
- **Parent Navigation**: Uses `current_pane['path'].parent` for reliable parent directory access
- **Type Checking**: Uses `file_path.is_dir()` for consistent directory identification

## Testing

### Unit Tests
The navigation system includes comprehensive unit tests in `test/test_parent_directory_navigation.py`:

- **Basic cursor positioning**: Verifies cursor is set to child directory
- **Nonexistent child handling**: Tests fallback when child directory doesn't exist
- **Root directory navigation**: Ensures proper handling at filesystem root

### Demo Scripts
- `demo/demo_parent_directory_cursor_positioning.py` - Interactive navigation demonstration

## Configuration Integration

### History Settings
- Uses `MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES` for fallback cursor history
- Integrates with existing scroll adjustment logic
- Works with both left and right panes independently

### Backward Compatibility
- Fully backward compatible with existing TFM installations
- No configuration changes required
- Existing cursor history functionality remains intact

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Multi-level navigation memory**: Remember cursor positions for multiple directory levels
2. **Smart positioning**: Consider file modification times or access patterns
3. **Visual indicators**: Highlight the directory we came from temporarily
4. **Configuration options**: Allow users to disable this behavior if desired

### Integration Opportunities
- **Breadcrumb navigation**: Could integrate with breadcrumb-style navigation
- **Quick navigation**: Could support quick jump-back functionality
- **History visualization**: Could show navigation history in status bar

# File Operations System

## Overview

Copy, move, duplicate, and delete are provided by a single class, `FileOperationService` (`tfm_file_operations.py`). It confirms the operation on the main thread, then runs the actual work as a background **task** (see [Task Framework](TASK_FRAMEWORK_IMPLEMENTATION.md)) whose body is one **linear** function — prepare → resolve conflicts → count → execute, top to bottom. There is no state machine and no separate UI / executor / list-manager split; the earlier four-layer design was removed in the PuiKit port.

The same service instance serves any view. `TfmApp` owns one (`self._fileops = FileOperationService(config, self.tasks)`); a full-window modal such as the directory-diff viewer can construct its own and pass a higher `z` so its dialogs stack above itself.

## Public API

```python
FileOperationService(config, tasks: TaskManager | None = None)
```

Each entry point takes the `panel` to draw on plus keyword options (`on_complete`, `log`, `z`, `background`):

| Method | Destination | Confirm flag | Conflict handling |
|---|---|---|---|
| `copy(panel, targets, dest_dir, …)` | `dest_dir/name` | `CONFIRM_COPY` | per-file prompt |
| `move(panel, targets, dest_dir, …)` | `dest_dir/name` | `CONFIRM_MOVE` | per-file prompt |
| `duplicate(panel, targets, dest_dir, …)` | in place (source's own dir) | `CONFIRM_DUPLICATE` | none — always auto-renamed `name (N)` |
| `delete(panel, targets, …)` | — | `CONFIRM_DELETE` (default button = Cancel) | — |

`_start` shows the relevant `CONFIRM_*` message box (skipped when its config flag is off); on confirm, `_submit` builds a `Task` and hands it to `TaskManager.submit(run=self._run, …)`.

## The linear worker (`_run`)

Runs on the task thread, top to bottom:

1. **Plan.** Build a list of `(target, dest_base, overwrite)`:
   - **delete** — trivial (one entry per target).
   - **duplicate** — pre-plan a fresh ` (N)` name per target (an in-place copy always collides, so it never prompts).
   - **copy / move** — `_resolve` checks each destination for an existing file and prompts only for collisions.
2. **Count.** `_count` recursively totals the nodes and bytes to process, so the progress bar is determinate. A same-storage move is a single atomic rename, so it counts as one node and its subtree is never walked (`_is_atomic_move`).
3. **Execute.** For each planned target: `task.checkpoint()` (cancellation point), then `_execute_one`, updating `task.progress`. Per-target exceptions are recorded in `errors` and processing continues; a `Cancelled` unwinds the loop.

### Result summary

`_run` returns a dict the caller reports via `format_op_summary` / `format_op_errors`:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `done` / `skipped` / `failed` | counts of **top-level targets** (what the user selected) |
| `items` | total individual entries actually processed (recursive) |
| `errors` | list of `(name, message)` for failed targets |
| `cancelled` | `True` if a checkpoint or a "Cancel" conflict choice unwound the run |

A top-level target is `done` if any of its entries succeeded; `failed` only if it produced nothing and raised. Inner file failures stay in `errors` without sinking the whole target.

## Conflict resolution (`ConflictDialog`)

For copy/move, `_resolve` prompts per collision through the task's UI bridge — `task.ask(_conflict_prompt(...))` pushes a `ConflictDialog` (a `FocusContainer` + `Widget`) that stacks just above the progress dialog. It offers four actions plus an **apply-to-all-remaining** checkbox, and reports `(action, apply_to_all)`:

| Action | Key | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Overwrite | `o` | replace the destination (`overwrite=True`) |
| Skip | `s` | leave it; increment `skipped` |
| Keep both | `k` | write to a fresh `name (N)` (via `_unique_dest`) |
| Cancel | `c` / `Esc` | raise `Cancelled` — abort the whole operation |

`a` / Space toggles apply-to-all, Tab moves focus, Enter activates the focused button. When apply-to-all is checked, the chosen action is reused for every remaining collision without prompting.

## Duplicate

In-place duplication (GitHub issue #192) is a thin `"duplicate"` operation kind layered onto the shared copy engine, plus app wiring for the two entry points. No new copy/rename logic was written — it reuses `_unique_dest()` and the existing threaded task pipeline.

### Engine — `src/tfm_file_operations.py`

`"duplicate"` is registered alongside `copy`/`move`/`delete`:

- `_VERB["duplicate"] = "Duplicate"`, `_OP_TYPE["duplicate"] = OperationType.COPY`.
- `FileOperationService.duplicate(panel, targets, dest_dir, …)` mirrors `copy()` and calls `_start(..., "duplicate", ...)`. `dest_dir` is the source's own directory.

It differs from copy in exactly one place — plan building in `_run()`. A duplicate always collides with itself, so it **never prompts**; instead every target is pre-planned to a fresh ` (N)` name up front:

```python
elif kind == "duplicate":
    plan = [(t, _unique_dest(dest_dir, t.name, is_dir=t.is_dir()), False)
            for t in targets]
    result["created"] = [dest.name for _t, dest, _o in plan]
```

Because distinct targets in one directory have distinct names, computing all destinations against the pre-op filesystem state is collision-free (unlike duplicating the *same* file twice, which cannot happen — targets are distinct list entries). `result["created"]` carries the new names back to the caller for cursor placement.

Everything else falls through the copy path: `_count()` walks the plan, `_execute_one()` routes to `_copy_tree()` (the `if kind == "move"` source-delete is skipped, so the original is never removed), and the per-file log line reads "Duplicated" via the verb map `{"move": "Moved", "duplicate": "Duplicated"}.get(kind, "Copied")`.

The confirm prompt in `_start()` gets a duplicate-specific line ("Duplicate **N** item(s) in `<dir>`?") and honors `CONFIRM_DUPLICATE` through the existing `getattr(config, f"CONFIRM_{verb.upper()}", True)` — no special casing needed. `CONFIRM_DUPLICATE = True` lives in `src/_config.py`.

### App wiring — `tfm.py`

Two entry points, one shared runner:

- `duplicate_files()` — guards (virtual pane, read-only archive, empty targets), gathers `_selected_or_focused(pane)`, then delegates to `_run_duplicate`. Returns `True` on a synchronous guard bail, `False` after handoff — same contract as `copy_files()`.
- `_run_duplicate(pane, targets)` — calls `self._fileops.duplicate(...)` with `pane["path"]` as the destination. `on_complete` clears the source selection, refreshes via `_refresh(pane, on_ready=lambda p: _select_by_name(p, created[0]))` so the cursor lands on the new copy, logs `format_op_summary("Duplicate", …)`, and reports failures.

Reachability (no default key binding):

- Dispatch: `elif action == "duplicate_files": return self.duplicate_files()` — so a user-defined `duplicate_files` key binding works.
- Menu bar (`_build_menu` → File menu) and right-click context menu (`_show_context_menu`): a **Duplicate** item after **Rename…**.

The same-directory copy relaxation lives in `_transfer()`: when `dest_dir == src_pane["path"]` and `kind == "copy"`, it routes to `_run_duplicate(src_pane, targets)` instead of logging the old "source and destination are the same directory" error. Move keeps that error.

### Tests

`test/test_file_operations.py` — the `cfg` fixture sets `CONFIRM_DUPLICATE = False` for headless runs; tests exercise file, directory, and multi-target duplication (each getting its own ` (N)`) plus the "Duplicated" log line, all via the existing `_run_sync(svc, svc.duplicate, …)` harness.

## Helpers

- `recursive_delete(entry)` — delete a file or directory tree.
- `_unique_dest(dest_dir, name, is_dir=…)` — the shared ` (N)` non-colliding-name scheme (used by duplicate and "Keep both").
- `_is_atomic_move(kind, target, dest_dir)` — true when a move stays within one storage backend (a single rename); a cross-storage move copies the tree then deletes the source.
- `format_op_summary(verb, result)` / `format_op_errors(verb, result)` — human-readable reporting from the result dict.

## Integration

- `TfmApp.__init__` — `self.tasks = TaskManager()`, `self._fileops = FileOperationService(self.config, self.tasks)`.
- `TfmApp.copy_files()` / `move_files()` / `duplicate_files()` / `delete_files()` gather the active pane's selection and delegate to `self._fileops`, passing an `on_complete` that refreshes panes and logs the summary.

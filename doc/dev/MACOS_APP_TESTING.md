### Test 8: Error Handling

**Warning:** This test temporarily breaks the app bundle. Only perform if you want to verify error handling.

**Steps:**
1. Quit TFM.app if running
2. Temporarily rename Python.framework:
   ```bash
   cd macos_app/build/TFM.app/Contents/Frameworks
   mv Python.framework Python.framework.backup
   ```
3. Try to launch TFM.app: `open ../../TFM.app`
4. Observe error dialog
5. Restore Python.framework:
   ```bash
   mv Python.framework.backup Python.framework
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- Error dialog appears with clear message
- Message mentions Python initialization failure
- Message suggests possible causes and reinstalling TFM
- Application terminates gracefully after clicking OK

**Verification:**
- Error dialog is properly formatted
- Error message is clear and helpful
- No crash or hang
- Console.app shows detailed error logs

### Test 9: Development Mode Compatibility

**Steps:**
1. Open Terminal and navigate to project directory
2. Run TFM in terminal mode: `python3 tfm.py`
3. Quit (press Q)
4. Run TFM in desktop mode: `python3 tfm.py --desktop`
5. Quit (press Q)

**Expected Results:**
- Terminal mode launches with curses interface
- Desktop mode launches with CoreGraphics window
- Both modes work correctly
- No errors or warnings
- Source changes take effect immediately (no rebuild needed)

**Verification:**
- Both modes launch successfully
- Terminal mode uses curses backend
- Desktop mode uses CoreGraphics backend
- No conflicts with app bundle
- Development workflow unchanged

4. Perform file operations on large files
5. Leave app running for extended period
6. Switch between TFM and other applications

**Expected Results:**
- Large directories load quickly
- Scrolling is smooth even with many files
- Multiple windows don't slow down the app
- Large file operations complete successfully
- No memory leaks or performance degradation
- App switching works smoothly

**Verification:**
- Responsive UI at all times

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Launch

**Possible Causes:**
- Missing or corrupted Python.framework
- Missing TFM source files in Resources
- Build script errors

**Solutions:**
1. Check Console.app for error messages
2. Verify Python.framework exists: `ls macos_app/build/TFM.app/Contents/Frameworks/`
3. Verify TFM source files exist: `ls macos_app/build/TFM.app/Contents/Resources/tfm/`
4. Try rebuilding: `cd macos_app && ./build.sh`

### Window Doesn't Appear

**Possible Causes:**
- Window hidden behind other windows
- Python errors during initialization
- CoreGraphics backend issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check if window is hidden (use Mission Control or Cmd+Tab)
2. Check Console.app for Python errors
3. Verify CoreGraphics backend is working
4. Try development mode: `python3 tfm.py --desktop`

### Keyboard/Mouse Not Working

**Possible Causes:**
- Window doesn't have focus
- Accessibility permissions not granted
- Input event handling issues

**Solutions:**
1. Verify window has focus (click on it)
2. Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility
3. Grant accessibility permissions if prompted
4. Try restarting the application

### File Operations Fail

**Possible Causes:**
- Insufficient file permissions
- Insufficient disk space
- File system errors

**Solutions:**
1. Check file permissions: `ls -la`
2. Verify sufficient disk space: `df -h`
3. Check Console.app for error messages
4. Try operations in development mode to isolate issue

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter issues during testing:

### 1. Check Console.app for Error Logs

```bash
# Open Console.app and filter for "TFM" or "Python"
# Copy relevant error messages
```

### 2. Gather System Information

```bash
# macOS version
sw_vers

# Python version
python3 --version

# TFM version (check Info.plist)
plutil -p macos_app/build/TFM.app/Contents/Info.plist | grep CFBundleVersion
```

### 3. Document Steps to Reproduce

- What were you doing when the issue occurred?
- Can you reproduce it consistently?
- Does it happen in development mode too?

### 4. Create Issue Report

Include:
- Error messages from Console.app
- System information
- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshots if relevant

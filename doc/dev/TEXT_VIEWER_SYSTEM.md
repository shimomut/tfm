# Text Viewer System Documentation

## Overview

TFM includes a comprehensive built-in text file viewer with syntax highlighting, search functionality, and remote file support. The viewer provides a clean, efficient way to view text files from both local and remote storage without leaving the file manager.

## Core Features

### ✅ Syntax Highlighting
- **Automatic detection** of file types via pygments' filename lexer, with an
  extension fallback map (`_EXT_LEXERS`) for common source types
- **Pygments integration** for syntax highlighting (a soft dependency)
- **Graceful fallback** to plain text when pygments is not available

### ✅ Navigation Controls
- **Vertical scrolling**: `↑↓` arrow keys
- **Horizontal scrolling**: `←→` arrow keys
- **Page navigation**: `Page Up/Down` for faster scrolling
- **Jump to start/end**: `Home/End` keys
- **Smooth scrolling** with proper boundary handling

### ✅ Display Options
- **Line numbers**: Toggle with `n` key (on by default)
- **Line wrapping**: Toggle with `w` key (off by default)
- **Syntax highlighting**: Toggle with `s` key (on by default if pygments available)
- **Status bar**: Shows current position, file size, format, and active options
- **Clean interface** with comprehensive information display

### ✅ Search Functionality
- **Incremental search**: Press `f` to search within the current file
- **Real-time highlighting**: Search matches highlighted as you type
- **Case-insensitive**: Finds matches regardless of case
- **Navigation**: Use `↑↓` to move between matches
- **Visual feedback**: Current match highlighted differently from other matches
- **Match counter**: Shows current match position and total matches

### ✅ Remote File Support
- **Unified file access** using tfm_path abstraction layer
- **Transparent handling** of different storage backends (local, S3, etc.)
- **Remote file detection** with scheme display in header
- **Enhanced error handling** for network and permission issues

## File Format Support

Highlighting is driven by pygments, so any language pygments has a lexer for is
supported. Lexer selection is:

1. `pygments.lexers.get_lexer_for_filename(path.name)` — pygments' own filename
   matching (handles `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `.rst`, and most extensions).
2. On `ClassNotFound`, a small extension fallback map, `_EXT_LEXERS` in
   `tfm_text_viewer.py` (`.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.json`, `.md`, `.yml`/`.yaml`,
   `.xml`, `.html`, `.css`, `.sh`/`.bash`, `.c`/`.cpp`/`.h`/`.hpp`, `.java`,
   `.go`, `.rs`, `.php`, `.rb`, `.sql`, `.ini`/`.cfg`/`.conf`, `.toml`).
3. Otherwise `TextLexer` (plain, uncolored).

Token categories are mapped to a small palette (`DEFAULT_SYNTAX`, VS Code Dark+)
that a theme may override via `extras['syntax']`. Structured formats such as
JSON and CSV also have dedicated *rich* renderers (see
`JSON_CSV_VIEWERS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`) reachable via the view-mode toggle.

## Usage

### Opening Files
1. **Navigate** to a text file in TFM
2. **Press Enter** to open in text viewer (automatic for text files)
3. **Press `v`** to explicitly open in text viewer
4. **Non-text files** will show file info instead

### Viewer Controls

| `q` or `ESC` | Exit viewer and return to TFM |
| `↑↓` | Scroll up/down |
| `←→` | Scroll left/right |
| `Page Up/Down` | Page scrolling |
| `Home/End` | Jump to start/end of file |
| `n` | Toggle line numbers on/off |
| `w` | Toggle line wrapping on/off |
| `s` | Toggle syntax highlighting on/off |
| `f` or `F` | Enter search mode |

### Search Controls
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `f` or `F` | Enter search mode |
| `ESC` or `Enter` | Exit search mode |
| `Backspace` | Remove last search character |
| `↑` or `k` | Previous match |
| `↓` or `j` | Next match |
| Type characters | Add to search pattern (incremental) |

### Status Information
The viewer interface provides comprehensive status information:

**Header:**
- **File name** and path with storage scheme (e.g., "S3: filename.txt" for remote files)
- **Keyboard controls** for quick reference

**Status Bar (bottom):**
- **Current position**: Line number and scroll percentage
- **File information**: Size and format type
- **Horizontal scroll**: Column position when scrolled
- **Active options**: NUM (line numbers), WRAP (line wrapping), SYNTAX (highlighting)
- **Search status**: Current match position and total matches when searching

## Remote File Support

### Unified File Access
The text viewer uses tfm_path's abstraction layer to support both local and remote files:

- **Transparent handling** of different storage backends
- **Consistent API** regardless of file location
- **Automatic detection** of remote files based on URI scheme

### Supported Remote Storage
Currently supports any storage backend implemented in the tfm_path system:
- **Local files**: Standard filesystem access
- **S3**: AWS S3 buckets (`s3://bucket/key`)
- **Extensible**: New storage backends can be added by implementing `PathImpl`

### Remote File Detection
- Automatically detects remote files based on URI scheme
- Shows remote scheme in the header:
  - Local files: `File: example.txt`
  - S3 files: `S3: example.txt`
  - Other remote: `SCHEME: example.txt`

### Enhanced Error Handling
Specific exception handling for different error types:
- `FileNotFoundError` for missing files
- `PermissionError` for access denied
- `OSError` for general I/O errors
- Network-specific errors for remote files

## Technical Implementation

### File Loading Process

#### 1. Text Reading
Uses `file_path.read_text()` with multiple encoding attempts:
- UTF-8 (primary)
- Latin-1 (fallback)
- CP1252 (Windows fallback)

#### 2. Binary Detection
If text reading fails, attempts `file_path.read_bytes()`:
- Checks for null bytes to identify binary files
- Uses Latin-1 as final fallback for edge cases
- Works with both local and remote files

#### 3. Error Handling
```python
try:
    content = file_path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
except FileNotFoundError:
    # File doesn't exist
except PermissionError:
    # Access denied
except OSError as e:
    # General I/O error (including network issues)
```

### Syntax Highlighting Implementation
The text viewer uses a **curses-native approach** to syntax highlighting:

1. **Pygments tokenization** - Uses pygments to parse and tokenize source code
2. **Token-to-color mapping** - Maps pygments token types to curses color pairs
3. **Line-by-line rendering** - Renders each line as a sequence of colored text segments
4. **No ANSI escape sequences** - Direct curses color application for proper terminal compatibility

### File Detection
Multi-step approach to identify text files:

1. **Extension matching** against known text file extensions
2. **Filename matching** for common files without extensions (README, Makefile, etc.)
3. **Content analysis** - reads first 1KB to detect binary vs text content
4. **Encoding detection** - tries UTF-8, Latin-1, and CP1252 encodings

### Performance Optimizations

#### Local Files
- **Efficient tokenization** - Pygments tokenization done once per file load
- **Optimized rendering** - Only visible content is rendered to screen
- **Memory conscious** - Handles large files appropriately
- **Fast scrolling** - Smooth navigation with proper color handling

#### Remote Files
- **Caching** - S3 implementation includes built-in caching for metadata and content
- **Network efficiency** - Uses tfm_path's optimized remote operations
- **Minimal data transfer** - Binary detection only reads first 1024 bytes
- **Streaming support** - Through tfm_path abstraction

### Horizontal scrolling

Content is drawn in a fixed-advance face (`MONO`), so a column is a character and
the gutter, horizontal scroll, and highlights all align by column. `self.left`
(and `self.top`) are floats, so a GUI pan is smooth rather than cell-snapped.

Tabs are expanded once at read time by the module function `_expand_tabs()`,
column-aware to `_TAB` (8) stops; `_read_lines()` runs it on every line, so the
rest of the viewer never sees a raw tab.

`_draw_line(ctx, y, line_idx, col0)` renders the visible column window
`[col0, col0 + content_w)`. It walks the line's `(text, fg)` segments tracking a
running character index `col`, clips each to `vis_start = max(col, col0_int)` /
`vis_end = min(seg_end, window_end)`, and slices by index arithmetic. `col0` may
be fractional: the row shifts left by its fractional part (`xfrac`) for smooth
pan, the gutter fill (drawn after) masks the left bleed, and the body's clip
trims the partial right edge.

> **War story — don't locate a character by value.** An earlier version found the
> first visible character with `text.index(char)`. `str.index` returns the
> *first occurrence of that character value*, not the character's position, so
> any line containing a repeated character (e.g. `0123450123...`) rendered from
> the wrong column at horizontal offsets past the repeat. The durable fix is to
> never search for a character by value — track the running character index
> explicitly (the current code's accumulating `col`).

### Text selection

Mouse text selection + clipboard copy in the modal viewer. The feature spans two
repos:

- **PuiKit** owns the reusable pieces — the `clipboard_rich` capability
  (`Panel.set_clipboard_rich`) and `MarkdownView`'s own selection + rich-HTML
  copy (documented in `puikit/docs/widget_catalog.md`).
- **TFM** owns the raw text viewer's own selection, and forwarding mouse/keys to
  the embedded `MarkdownView` in rich mode.

**Raw text mode.** `_RawTextSelection` holds a `(line, col)` selection over the
source lines (monospace, so a column is a character), using PuiKit's
`MultiClickTracker` + `word_bounds` for the word/line gestures. It is a local
counterpart to PuiKit's `SelectableText` mixin, which can't be reused because
this viewer scrolls vertically **and** horizontally and draws its own line-number
gutter. `_pos_at(ex, ey)` maps a layer-local point through `_body_rect` and the
current `top`/`left` scroll (unwrapping `_row_map` when wrapping) to a
`(line, col)`; `_draw_selection` overlays the selected span of each visible row
over `theme.text_selection_bg` (mirroring the search-match overlay
`_draw_matches`). `handle_event` processes `MOUSE_DOWN`/`UP`/`DRAG` plus
`Cmd`/`Ctrl`+`C` (copy, plain text via `Panel.set_clipboard`) and
`Cmd`/`Ctrl`+`A` (select-all); a press outside the body clears the selection.

**Rich mode.** `_forward_mouse_to_rich` translates a mouse event into the
embedded `MarkdownView`'s coordinate space (`event.translated(-bx0, -by0)`) so
its own selection and link clicks work through this modal viewer. KEY events
(including `Cmd`+`C`) are already forwarded in rich mode, so the widget's copy
path needs no extra wiring. `tfm_viewer_registry._build_markdown` builds the
file viewer's `MarkdownView` with `selectable=True`; help / message-box
MarkdownViews build without the flag and stay inert.

Tests: `test/test_viewer_selection.py` (raw-mode drag / multi-line / select-all /
press-outside-clears, and rich-mode mouse + copy forwarding). User-facing
behavior: `doc/TEXT_VIEWER_FEATURE.md`.

## Installation & Dependencies

### Core Functionality
The text viewer works with **no external dependencies** - it uses Python's built-in libraries and the curses interface.

### Enhanced Syntax Highlighting
For **full syntax highlighting support**, install pygments:

```bash
pip install pygments
```

**Without pygments**: The viewer still works but displays files as plain text without syntax coloring.

**With pygments**: Syntax highlighting for any language pygments can lex, using the theme's syntax palette.

### Remote File Support
Remote file support is provided through the tfm_path system:
- **S3 support**: Requires `boto3` library for AWS S3 access
- **Other backends**: May require additional libraries depending on implementation

## Usage Examples

The viewer is a full-window modal PuiKit `Widget`, pushed over the active panel
with `show_text_viewer`:

### Viewing Local Files
```python
from tfm_path import Path
from tfm_text_viewer import show_text_viewer

# Local file
show_text_viewer(panel, Path('/home/user/document.txt'), state_manager=state_manager)
```

### Viewing Remote Files
```python
# S3 file (same call — tfm_path.Path abstracts the backend)
show_text_viewer(panel, Path('s3://my-bucket/document.txt'))
```

### Text File Detection

There is no `is_text_file()` predicate to call ahead of time, and no list of
text extensions — **the viewer decides from the file's bytes as it reads it**:

```python
from tfm_text_viewer import looks_binary

looks_binary(path)                    # NUL byte in the first 1024 bytes
lines, is_error = _read_lines(path)   # placeholder line when binary
```

`_read_lines()` sniffs with `looks_binary()` **before** attempting any decode,
then tries `utf-8`, `latin-1`, `cp1252` for everything else.

> **The ordering is load-bearing, not stylistic.** `latin-1` maps all 256 byte
> values, so it never raises `UnicodeDecodeError` — any decode loop containing
> it always succeeds. This code originally sniffed only *after* the loop, in an
> "if nothing decoded" branch that could therefore never run: the placeholder
> was unreachable and a PNG rendered as ~45,000 lines of mojibake. If you
> reorder this, `test/test_binary_file_handling.py` will fail.

Content search needs a cheaper, standalone check and has its own:
`TfmApp._looks_textual(path)` in `tfm.py`. It differs deliberately — an empty
file is "nothing to grep" (False) but is perfectly viewable (not binary).

The principle: **detect capability from the bytes, configure preference by
extension.** Extension lists belong in FILE_ASSOCIATIONS (which application the
user prefers), never in text detection — they get files with no extension, an
unknown one, or a misleading one wrong, and sniffing gets all three right.

### Example File Types

#### Python Code
```python
# test_syntax.py - automatically highlighted
def hello_world():
    """A simple function"""
    message = "Hello, World!"
    print(f"Message: {message}")
    return True
```

#### JSON Data
```json
{
  "name": "TFM Text Viewer",
  "features": ["syntax highlighting", "line numbers", "remote support"],
  "supported": true
}
```

#### Configuration Files
```ini
# config.ini - automatically detected and highlighted
[section]
key = value
debug = true
```

## Error Scenarios

### Local File Errors
```
File not found: /path/to/missing.txt
Permission denied: /path/to/restricted.txt
[Binary file - cannot display as text]
```

### Remote File Errors
```
File not found: s3://bucket/missing.txt
Permission denied: s3://private-bucket/restricted.txt
Error reading file: Connection timeout
Network error: Unable to connect to S3
```

## Integration with TFM

### Seamless Experience
- **Automatic detection** - Enter key opens text files in viewer, directories navigate normally
- **Consistent interface** - viewer uses same color scheme and key patterns as TFM
- **State preservation** - returns to exact same TFM state after viewing
- **Log integration** - viewer actions logged to TFM's log pane

### Configuration
The text viewer respects TFM's configuration system:
- **Key bindings** can be customized in `~/.tfm/config.py`
- **Color schemes** integrate with TFM's color system
- **Behavior settings** follow TFM's configuration patterns

## Testing

- `test/test_binary_file_handling.py` — the binary-sniff ordering described in
  *Text File Detection* above (a PNG must not render as mojibake).
- `test/test_viewer_selection.py` — raw-mode and rich-mode text selection / copy.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Regular expression search** for advanced pattern matching
2. **Bookmarks** for large files
3. **Split view** for comparing files
4. **Custom color themes** for syntax highlighting
5. **Plugin system** for additional file format support
6. **Search history** and replace functionality
7. **Streaming support** for very large remote files
8. **Progress indicators** for slow remote file loading

### Extension Points
- New storage backends can be added to tfm_path
- TextViewer automatically supports new backends
- No changes required to TextViewer code for new storage types

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Syntax Highlighting
**Q: Syntax highlighting not working**
A: Install pygments with `pip install pygments`

# Task Framework Implementation

## Overview

The task framework (`tfm_task.py`) runs long operations — file copy/move/delete, archive create/extract, directory-diff content comparison — on a background thread while the UI stays responsive, without letting worker code touch the UI directly.

A **task** is an ordinary `run(task)` function handed to `TaskManager.submit()`. The manager shows a modal `ProgressDialog`, spawns one worker thread, and services the task's UI bridge on each animation tick. From the worker the job body can:

- report progress through `task.progress` (a `ProgressManager`),
- request a modal dialog and block for the answer via `task.ask(...)`, and
- cooperatively cancel via `task.checkpoint()` / `task.cancelled()`.

The worker **never** calls into the panel or any widget itself — every UI interaction is marshalled to the main thread. This replaced the pre-PuiKit-port `BaseTask` / `FileOperationTask` state-machine design; there is no per-operation state machine any more, just a linear worker plus a small status enum.

## `Task`

A `Task` is the handle shared between the worker thread and the main thread.

| Member | Called on | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `progress` | both | A `ProgressManager` the worker drives and the dialog reads |
| `status` | main | Current `TaskStatus` (see below) |
| `counted` | both | Items seen so far during the pre-total counting phase (display only) |
| `result` / `error` | both | The worker's return value / the exception it raised, if any |
| `ask(show_fn, *, headless)` | worker | Show a modal via `show_fn(panel, deliver)` on the main thread and **block** until it delivers an answer; raises `Cancelled` if cancelled while waiting. Returns `headless` without prompting in synchronous mode. |
| `checkpoint()` | worker | Raise `Cancelled` if cancellation was requested. Call between units of work (per file / per chunk). |
| `cancelled()` | worker | Non-raising check of the cancel flag |
| `request_cancel()` | main | Set the cooperative cancel flag; a blocked `ask()` wakes within `_WAIT_TICK` (50 ms) and unwinds |

Internally the cancel flag is a `threading.Event` and pending UI requests sit on a `queue.Queue` of `_UiRequest`. See [Cancellation](#cancellation) below for the full cancellation model.

### `TaskStatus`

```
PENDING → RUNNING → DONE | CANCELLED | FAILED
```

`PENDING` (submitted, worker not started) → `RUNNING` (worker active) → one terminal state: `DONE` (finished normally), `CANCELLED` (cancelled before or during the run), or `FAILED` (the worker raised an unexpected exception).

## `TaskManager`

One instance per app (`TfmApp.tasks`). It is the registry of live tasks and the main-thread pump.

- `active_tasks()` / `has_active()` — which tasks are `PENDING` or `RUNNING` (the app checks this to block conflicting actions).
- `submit(task, panel, *, run, on_done=None, z=70, background=True)` — run `run(task)`:
  - **Background mode (default):** show a `ProgressDialog`, set the task `RUNNING`, spawn a daemon worker thread that runs `run(task)` (recording `result` / `error`), and register an animation `tick()` callback. Each frame the tick pumps the UI bridge and repaints; when the worker finishes it closes the dialog, finalises status, and calls `on_done(result)` on the main thread.
  - **Synchronous mode (`background=False`, used by tests):** mark the task headless, run `run(task)` inline (so `ask()` resolves to its headless default and no dialog appears), finalise, and call `on_done` immediately.

On completion `TaskStatus` is set from the outcome — `FAILED` if the worker raised, `CANCELLED` if it was cancelled or returned a `cancelled` result, otherwise `DONE` — and the task is removed from the registry.

Today the manager runs **one modal task at a time**; the shape (a registry plus a generic dialog) is deliberately left open for background / queued execution and a task-management UI later.

## `ProgressDialog`

A generic modal progress surface (a PuiKit `Widget`) that renders purely from `task.title` and `task.progress`, so every task type reuses it. It shows three phases:

- **Preparing** — a `BusyIndicator` and `Preparing… (N items)` while the operation is still counting (no total yet).
- **Running** — a determinate primary `ProgressBar` (items done / total), the current item name, and a secondary byte bar shown only while the current file reports a byte total (large / remote copies).
- **Cancelling** — a `Cancelling…` line once cancellation is confirmed, until the worker unwinds.

It is modal: `handle_event` swallows all input, so while a task runs the rest of the app is inert. `Esc` opens a confirm box; confirming calls `task.request_cancel()`.

## The UI bridge (`ask` / `_UiRequest` / `pump`)

The bridge is how a worker safely drives a modal:

1. The worker calls `task.ask(show_fn, headless=…)`, which enqueues a `_UiRequest` and blocks on its event.
2. On the next main-thread tick, `ProgressDialog.pump()` pops **one** request and calls `show_fn(panel, deliver)`, which pushes the modal.
3. When the user answers, the widget calls `deliver(answer)`, which unblocks the worker's `ask()` with that value.

Only one request is serviced at a time — the worker blocks on the answer before it can post the next — so prompts (e.g. per-file copy conflicts) appear sequentially.

## Cancellation

Cancellation is **cooperative**: the main thread sets a flag, and the worker unwinds itself at the next safe point, leaving a clean partial result. Nothing is force-killed.

### The cooperative model

Each `Task` owns a `threading.Event` cancel flag (`_cancel`). Two calls on the worker thread observe it and raise `Cancelled` when it is set:

- `task.checkpoint()` — a non-UI check the worker calls between units of work (per file, per chunk).
- `task.ask(...)` — while blocked waiting for a modal answer, it wakes every `_WAIT_TICK` (50 ms) and raises `Cancelled` if the flag flipped, so a pending prompt cancels promptly instead of stranding the worker.

`task.cancelled()` is the non-raising form for spots that want to branch rather than unwind.

### Requesting cancellation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant U as User
    participant Dlg as ProgressDialog (main thread)
    participant T as Task (flag)
    participant W as worker thread

    U->>Dlg: press Esc
    Dlg->>U: confirm box — "Cancel <title>?" (default: Keep running)
    Note over W: worker keeps running while the user decides
    U-->>Dlg: choose "Cancel operation"
    Dlg->>T: request_cancel() — set _cancel Event
    W->>T: next checkpoint() / ask() sees the flag
    T-->>W: raise Cancelled
    W-->>Dlg: run() returns a partial result {cancelled: True}
```

`Esc` on the progress dialog does **not** cancel immediately — it opens a confirm box (`Cancel operation` / `Keep running`, defaulting to keep). The worker continues while the user decides; cancellation only takes effect if confirmed, at which point `task.request_cancel()` sets the flag.

A third path reaches the same place: choosing **Cancel** in a per-file conflict dialog raises `Cancelled` directly inside the operation's `_resolve` step.

### Unwinding into a partial result

`Cancelled` propagates up through the operation body, which catches it and returns a summary dict with `cancelled = True` (the counts reflect whatever completed before the cancel). `TaskManager` then maps the outcome to `TaskStatus.CANCELLED` when finalising the task, closes the dialog, and calls the caller's `on_done` with the partial result — so a cancelled copy still reports what it managed to copy.

### Blocking other actions

The `ProgressDialog` is pushed as a modal layer; its `handle_event` returns `True` for everything, so no key or mouse event reaches the panes or menus while a task runs. Blocking is therefore a property of the modal layer, not a special case in the key handler. For callers that need to know programmatically whether work is in flight, `TaskManager.has_active()` / `active_tasks()` report the `PENDING` / `RUNNING` tasks in the registry.

## Example: a file operation as a task

`FileOperationService` (see [File Operations System](FILE_OPERATIONS_SYSTEM.md)) builds and submits a task like this:

```python
task = Task("Copy…", config=self.config, kind="copy")
task.progress.start_operation("copy", 0, description="")

def run(task: Task) -> dict:
    return self._run(task, "copy", targets, dest_dir, panel, log, z)

self.tasks.submit(task, panel, run=run, on_done=on_complete, z=z, background=background)
```

The `run` body resolves conflicts (via `task.ask`), counts work (updating `task.progress`), then executes each target, calling `task.checkpoint()` between them. A `Cancelled` exception unwinds `run` into a clean partial-result dict.

## Implementation files

- `src/tfm_task.py` — `Task`, `TaskStatus`, `Cancelled`, `_UiRequest`, `TaskManager`, `ProgressDialog`; the cancellation machinery (`Task._cancel`, `checkpoint()`, `ask()`, `request_cancel()`; `ProgressDialog._confirm_cancel`; `TaskManager._finish`)
- `src/tfm_progress_manager.py` — `ProgressManager` (the per-task progress model)
- `src/tfm_file_operations.py` — the first heavy user of the framework (its `_run` / `_resolve` catch `Cancelled` and return a partial summary)

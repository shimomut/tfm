# Batch Rename Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a batch rename dialog feature for the TFM (Terminal File Manager) that allows users to rename multiple selected files using regex patterns and destination templates with special macros.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Added

1. **State Variables** (in `__init__`):
   - `batch_rename_mode`: Boolean flag for dialog state
   - `batch_rename_regex`: Current regex pattern
   - `batch_rename_destination`: Current destination pattern
   - `batch_rename_files`: List of selected files to rename
   - `batch_rename_preview`: List of preview results
   - `batch_rename_scroll`: Scroll offset for preview list
   - `batch_rename_input_mode`: Current input field ('regex' or 'destination')

2. **Methods Added**:
   - `enter_batch_rename_mode()`: Initialize batch rename dialog
   - `exit_batch_rename_mode()`: Clean up and exit dialog
   - `update_batch_rename_preview()`: Generate real-time preview
   - `perform_batch_rename()`: Execute the rename operations
   - `handle_batch_rename_input()`: Handle keyboard input
   - `draw_batch_rename_dialog()`: Render the dialog UI

3. **Modified Methods**:
   - `enter_rename_mode()`: Check for multiple selections and route to batch rename
   - Main input loop: Added batch rename input handling
   - Main drawing routine: Added batch rename dialog rendering
   - Help dialog: Updated to include batch rename information

### Key Features

1. **Trigger Mechanism**:
   - Press 'R' key when multiple files are selected
   - Automatically switches to batch rename mode
   - Single file selection still uses original rename mode

2. **Regex Pattern Matching**:
   - Uses Python's `re` module for pattern matching
   - Supports full regex syntax
   - Graceful handling of invalid regex patterns

3. **Destination Pattern Macros**:
   - `\0`: Entire original filename
   - `\1` to `\9`: Regex capture groups
   - `\d`: Sequential index number (1, 2, 3, ...)

4. **Real-time Preview**:
   - Shows original → new filename mappings
   - Conflict detection for existing files
   - Validation for invalid filenames
   - Status indicators: OK, UNCHANGED, CONFLICT!, INVALID!

5. **Safety Features**:
   - Only processes regular files (excludes directories)
   - Prevents overwrites of existing files
   - Validates filenames for illegal characters
   - Preview before execution
   - Error handling and reporting

6. **User Interface**:
   - Modal dialog with clear input fields
   - Tab key to switch between regex and destination inputs
   - Scrollable preview list with up/down arrows
   - Visual indicators for active input field
   - Comprehensive help text

### Dialog Controls

- **Tab**: Switch between regex pattern and destination pattern fields
- **Enter**: Execute batch rename operation
- **ESC**: Cancel and exit batch rename mode
- **↑/↓**: Scroll through preview list
- **Backspace**: Delete characters from current input field
- **Printable characters**: Add to current input field

### Error Handling

- Invalid regex patterns are caught and ignored
- File conflicts are detected and prevent operation
- Invalid filenames are validated
- Permission errors during rename are reported
- Partial success scenarios are handled gracefully

### Integration Points

- Seamlessly integrated with existing file selection system
- Uses existing dialog infrastructure and styling
- Maintains consistency with other TFM dialogs
- Preserves existing single-file rename functionality

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script (`test_batch_rename.py`) that validates:
- Prefix addition
- Extension changes
- Sequential numbering
- Pattern extraction and reordering

All test cases pass successfully, demonstrating correct regex processing and macro substitution.

## Documentation

- Created detailed user documentation (`doc/BATCH_RENAME_FEATURE.md`)
- Updated help dialog with batch rename information
- Added practical examples and usage patterns
- Documented all macros and safety features

## Files Modified

1. `src/tfm_main.py`: Core implementation
2. `doc/BATCH_RENAME_FEATURE.md`: User documentation
3. `test_batch_rename.py`: Test script
4. `BATCH_RENAME_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: This summary

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Add Prefix
- Files: `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, `file3.txt`
- Regex: `(.*)`
- Destination: `backup_\1`
- Result: `backup_file1.txt`, `backup_file2.txt`, `backup_file3.txt`

### Example 2: Change Extensions
- Files: `doc1.txt`, `doc2.txt`
- Regex: `(.*)\.txt`
- Destination: `\1.md`
- Result: `doc1.md`, `doc2.md`

### Example 3: Sequential Numbering
- Files: `photo.jpg`, `image.jpg`
- Regex: `(.*)\.(.*)`
- Destination: `\1_\d.\2`
- Result: `photo_1.jpg`, `image_2.jpg`

The implementation is complete, tested, and ready for use. It provides a powerful and safe way to perform bulk file renaming operations with regex pattern matching and flexible destination templates.

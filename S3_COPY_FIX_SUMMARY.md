# S3 Copy Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: Copy operations from local filesystem to S3 failed with "Permission denied: Cannot write to s3://shimomut-files/test1/dir1/"

**Root Cause**: TFM was using `os.access()` to check write permissions on destination directories, but `os.access()` only works with local filesystem paths and returns `False` for S3 URIs, causing the copy operation to be blocked before it even started.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Permission Check Logic

**Primary Fix**: Updated permission checks in `src/tfm_main.py` to only apply `os.access()` to local filesystem paths:

**Before**:
```python
if not os.access(destination_dir, os.W_OK):
    print(f"Permission denied: Cannot write to {destination_dir}")
    return
```

**After**:
```python
if destination_dir.get_scheme() == 'file' and not os.access(destination_dir, os.W_OK):
    print(f"Permission denied: Cannot write to {destination_dir}")
    return
```

This change was applied to:
- `copy_selected_files()` method
- `create_directory()` method  
- `create_file()` method
- `move_selected_files()` method

### 2. New Cross-Storage Copy Method

Added `copy_to()` method to the `Path` class in `src/tfm_path.py`:
- Handles copying between different storage systems (local ↔ S3)
- Automatically detects source and destination storage types
- Uses appropriate APIs for each storage combination
- Includes proper error handling and overwrite control

### 3. Updated TFM Copy Operations

Modified `src/tfm_main.py` to use the new copy method:
- Replaced `shutil.copy2(source_file, dest_path)` with `source_file.copy_to(dest_path, overwrite=overwrite)`
- Updated both file and directory copy operations
- Maintained existing progress tracking and conflict resolution

### 3. Storage-Specific Logic

**Local to Local**: Uses fast `shutil.copy2()` for optimal performance
**Local to S3**: Reads file content and uploads via S3 API
**S3 to Local**: Downloads via S3 API and writes to local filesystem
**S3 to S3**: Downloads and re-uploads (can be optimized in future)

## Files Modified

1. **`src/tfm_main.py`**:
   - **CRITICAL FIX**: Updated permission checks to only apply `os.access()` to local paths
   - Updated `copy_selected_files()` method
   - Updated `create_directory()` method
   - Updated `create_file()` method  
   - Updated `move_selected_files()` method
   - Updated `perform_copy_operation()` to use `copy_to()` method
   - Updated `_copy_directory_with_progress()` to use `copy_to()` method
   - Enhanced directory copy logic for cross-storage scenarios

2. **`src/tfm_path.py`**:
   - Added `copy_to()` method
   - Added `_copy_file_cross_storage()` helper method
   - Added `_copy_directory_cross_storage()` helper method
   - Fixed `write_text()` parameter issue in LocalPathImpl

## Files Created

1. **`test/test_s3_copy_fix.py`**: Comprehensive unit tests for the copy functionality
2. **`demo/demo_s3_copy_fix.py`**: Demonstration script showing the fix in action
3. **`doc/S3_COPY_FIX.md`**: Detailed documentation of the implementation
4. **`test/test_copy_simple.py`**: Simple test to verify basic functionality

## Key Benefits

✅ **Cross-Storage Compatibility**: Copy files between local filesystem and S3
✅ **Improved Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages with specific exception types
✅ **Consistent API**: Same copy interface for all storage types
✅ **Performance Optimization**: Local-to-local copies still use fast `shutil.copy2()`
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality continues to work unchanged
✅ **Progress Tracking**: Works for both local and cross-storage operations
✅ **Conflict Resolution**: Overwrite control works consistently across storage types

## Testing Results

- ✅ **Permission check fix**: S3 paths now bypass `os.access()` check
- ✅ **Local to local copy**: Working (unchanged performance)
- ✅ **Local to S3 copy**: Working (with mocked S3)
- ✅ **S3 to local copy**: Working (with mocked S3)
- ✅ **Error handling**: Working (FileNotFoundError, FileExistsError, overwrite logic)
- ✅ **Method existence**: copy_to() method exists and is callable
- ✅ **Backward compatibility**: Existing local operations unchanged
- ✅ **Cross-storage detection**: Correctly identifies file vs s3 schemes

## Usage

The fix works automatically when users perform copy operations in TFM:

1. Navigate to a local directory in one pane
2. Navigate to an S3 bucket in the other pane
3. Select files in the local directory
4. Press 'c' or 'C' to copy
5. Files are now successfully copied to S3

## Requirements

- AWS credentials properly configured
- `boto3` library installed for S3 support
- Appropriate S3 permissions (s3:PutObject, s3:GetObject)

## Future Enhancements

- S3-to-S3 optimization using native S3 copy operations
- Progress callbacks for large file transfers
- Metadata preservation improvements
- Parallel transfer support

## Conclusion

The S3 copy fix successfully resolves the "Permission denied" error when copying files from local filesystem to S3. The implementation is robust, maintains backward compatibility, and provides a foundation for future cross-storage enhancements.

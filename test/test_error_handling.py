"""
Test error handling in logging system.

This test verifies that:
1. Handler failures are isolated (one handler failing doesn't prevent others)
2. Remote client failures are handled gracefully
3. Stream write failures are suppressed

Run with: PYTHONPATH=.:src pytest test/test_error_handling.py -v

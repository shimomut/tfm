"""Search / isearch match highlights track the active theme.

The file-pane isearch wash and the text-viewer search-match backgrounds were
fixed dark constants, so they read dark on the light themes. They are now
derived from the pane/content background, so a match highlight is a dark wash on
a dark theme and a pale one on a light theme. The isearch wash also draws its
base hue from the theme's secondary accent (``accent2`` / an ``isearch_match``
override), and the text-viewer syntax palette is theme-configurable too.

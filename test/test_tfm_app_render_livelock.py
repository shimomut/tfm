"""Regression: a stray stdout/stderr write during render must not livelock the UI.

TFM routes stdout/stderr into the log pane (``_StreamToLog``), and every captured
line wakes the monitoring pump, which drains the line and re-renders so it shows.
That is correct for a *worker* thread posting output. But if anything writes to
stdout/stderr from the UI thread *during* the render itself, the render schedules
another wake, which drains and renders again, which writes again — a
self-sustaining cycle. The UI keeps responding (it is a livelock, not a deadlock)
while burning 100% of a core, which is what a user sees as "TFM hung".

The write can come from anywhere in the draw path: a ``logger.warning`` on a
handler-less logger falls through to ``logging.lastResort``, which writes to
stderr. No component has to be at fault for the loop to run away.

Run with: PYTHONPATH=.:src pytest test/test_tfm_app_render_livelock.py -v

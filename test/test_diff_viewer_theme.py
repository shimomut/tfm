"""The file diff viewer's band backgrounds track the active theme.

Previously the delete/insert/replace/empty bands were fixed dark RGB constants,
so a diff read dark on every theme (most rows are non-identical). They are now
derived from the theme's content background, so a band is dark on a dark theme
and pastel on a light one — while unchanged lines still never tint.

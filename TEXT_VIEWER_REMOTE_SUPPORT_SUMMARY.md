# TextViewer Remote File Support Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented remote file support for the TextViewer component using the tfm_path abstraction mechanism. The TextViewer can now seamlessly handle both local and remote files (such as S3 objects) with the same interface and functionality.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated File Loading (`load_file` method)
- **Before**: Used direct `open()` calls for local files only
- **After**: Uses `file_path.read_text()` and `file_path.read_bytes()` from tfm_path abstraction
- **Benefits**: Works transparently with both local and remote files

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Before**: Generic exception handling with bare `except` clauses
- **After**: Specific exception types with informative error messages:
  - `FileNotFoundError` for missing files
  - `PermissionError` for access denied
  - `OSError` for general I/O errors
- **Benefits**: Better debugging and user feedback

### 3. Updated Binary File Detection (`is_text_file` function)
- **Before**: Used direct file operations with `open()`
- **After**: Uses `file_path.read_bytes()` from tfm_path abstraction
- **Benefits**: Binary detection works for remote files

### 4. Enhanced Header Display
- **Before**: Always showed "File: filename"
- **After**: Shows storage scheme for remote files (e.g., "S3: filename")
- **Benefits**: Clear indication of file location

### 5. Improved File Size Calculation
- **Before**: Direct `os.stat()` calls
- **After**: Uses `file_path.stat()` from tfm_path abstraction
- **Benefits**: File size display works for remote files

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `src/tfm_text_viewer.py` - Main TextViewer class with remote support

### Testing
- `test/test_text_viewer_remote.py` - Comprehensive test suite for remote functionality

### Documentation
- `doc/TEXT_VIEWER_REMOTE_SUPPORT.md` - Detailed feature documentation

### Demo
- `demo/demo_text_viewer_remote.py` - Interactive demonstration script

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Reading Strategy
1. **Primary**: Try `read_text()` with multiple encodings (UTF-8, Latin-1, CP1252)
2. **Fallback**: Use `read_bytes()` for binary detection
3. **Error Handling**: Specific exception types with informative messages

### Remote File Detection
- Uses `file_path.is_remote()` to detect remote files
- Uses `file_path.get_scheme()` to get storage type (e.g., 's3', 'file')
- Header shows scheme for remote files

### Binary File Detection
- Reads first 1024 bytes using `read_bytes()`
- Checks for null bytes to identify binary files
- Falls back to encoding detection for text files

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
```
test_header_shows_remote_scheme ... ok
test_is_text_file_binary_remote ... ok  
test_is_text_file_remote ... ok
test_local_file_loading ... ok
test_remote_file_detection ... ok
test_remote_file_error_handling ... ok
test_view_text_file_remote ... ok

Ran 7 tests in 0.012s
OK
```

## Demo Results

The demo script successfully demonstrates:
- Local file support (unchanged functionality)
- Mock S3 file support with proper detection
- TextViewer initialization for both local and remote files
- Error handling for missing and restricted files
- Binary file detection for remote files

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Unified Interface
- Same TextViewer interface works for all file types
- No changes needed in calling code
- Transparent remote file support

### 2. Better Error Handling
- Specific exception types instead of generic errors
- Informative error messages displayed in viewer
- Graceful handling of network issues

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- Clear indication of remote files in header
- File size display works for remote files
- Same keyboard shortcuts and functionality

### 4. Maintainable Code
- Uses established tfm_path abstraction
- Follows project exception handling policy
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Integration with TFM

### Automatic Support
- No configuration changes required
- Works automatically when tfm_path detects remote URIs
- Inherits existing TFM settings and preferences

### File Manager Integration
- Press Enter/Space on remote text files to view
- Same interface as local files
- Supports all existing TextViewer features

## Future Extensibility

### New Storage Backends
- Adding new storage types to tfm_path automatically extends TextViewer
- No TextViewer code changes needed for new backends
- Consistent interface across all storage types

### Performance Optimizations
- Can leverage tfm_path caching mechanisms
- Streaming support possible through tfm_path
- Progress indicators can be added at tfm_path level

## Compliance with Project Standards

### File Placement
- Tests in `test/` directory
- Documentation in `doc/` directory  
- Demo in `demo/` directory
- Core code in `src/` directory

### Exception Handling Policy
- Uses specific exception types
- Includes informative error messages
- Follows established patterns

### External Programs Policy
- Uses tfm_path abstraction instead of direct file operations
- Maintains consistency with other TFM components

## Conclusion

The TextViewer remote file support implementation successfully extends TFM's text viewing capabilities to remote storage systems while maintaining full backward compatibility and following all project standards. The implementation is robust, well-tested, and ready for production use.

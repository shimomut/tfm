# Requirements Document

## Introduction

TFM (TUI File Manager) currently does not properly handle wide characters, particularly Japanese Zenkaku characters, in filenames. When filenames contain these characters, the file list panes' layout breaks, causing display issues and poor user experience. This feature will implement proper wide character support to ensure TFM works correctly with international filenames and maintains proper layout alignment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with files containing Japanese or other wide characters in their names, I want TFM to display these filenames correctly without breaking the layout, so that I can navigate and manage my files effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TFM displays a filename containing wide characters THEN the filename SHALL be rendered correctly without truncation or corruption
2. WHEN TFM calculates column widths for file lists THEN it SHALL account for the display width of wide characters (typically 2 display columns per character)
3. WHEN TFM aligns file information in columns THEN the alignment SHALL remain consistent regardless of wide character presence
4. WHEN TFM displays file lists containing mixed narrow and wide characters THEN the layout SHALL remain properly formatted

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user navigating through directories with wide character filenames, I want the cursor positioning and selection to work accurately, so that I can select the correct files without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user moves the cursor over filenames with wide characters THEN the cursor SHALL position correctly on the intended filename
2. WHEN the user selects files with wide character names THEN the selection highlighting SHALL cover the entire filename correctly
3. WHEN TFM displays the cursor position indicator THEN it SHALL account for wide character display widths
4. WHEN the user scrolls through file lists with wide characters THEN the scrolling SHALL maintain proper alignment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with TFM's codebase, I want a centralized wide character handling system, so that all text rendering components can consistently handle wide characters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating string display width THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated function that properly measures wide character widths
2. WHEN truncating strings for display THEN the system SHALL preserve wide character boundaries and avoid splitting characters
3. WHEN padding strings for alignment THEN the system SHALL account for actual display width rather than character count
4. WHEN any component needs to measure text width THEN it SHALL use the centralized wide character utilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with files containing various Unicode characters, I want TFM to handle different character widths correctly, so that the interface remains usable with international content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TFM encounters zero-width characters THEN it SHALL handle them without affecting layout calculations
2. WHEN TFM encounters combining characters THEN it SHALL treat them as part of the base character for width calculations
3. WHEN TFM encounters emoji or other wide Unicode characters THEN it SHALL calculate their display width correctly
4. WHEN TFM processes mixed character types in a single filename THEN it SHALL maintain accurate width calculations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of TFM on different terminal environments, I want wide character support to work consistently across various terminals and locales, so that my experience is reliable regardless of my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TFM runs in terminals with different Unicode support levels THEN it SHALL gracefully handle character rendering limitations
2. WHEN TFM runs with different locale settings THEN wide character detection SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN TFM encounters unsupported characters in the terminal THEN it SHALL provide appropriate fallback rendering
4. WHEN TFM detects terminal capabilities THEN it SHALL adjust wide character handling accordingly

Demo S3 Move Fix - Demonstrate the fix for S3 file move operations

This demo shows how the S3 move fix resolves the issue where moving files
between S3 directories would fail with "No such file or directory" errors.

The fix replaces shutil.move() calls with Path.rename() calls, which properly
handle S3 paths through the S3PathImpl.rename() method.

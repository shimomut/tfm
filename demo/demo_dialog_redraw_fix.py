Demo script showing the dialog redraw fix in action.

This script demonstrates that dialogs remain visible after main screen redraws,
even when the dialog content hasn't changed.

    print("PROBLEM:")
    print("- In FileManager.run(), after rendering the main screen, needs_full_redraw is set to False")
    print("- Then _draw_dialogs_if_needed() is called")
    print("- If dialog content hasn't changed, _check_dialog_content_changed() returns False")

    print("SOLUTION:")
    print("- Move the needs_full_redraw = False assignment to after both main screen AND dialogs are rendered")
    print("- This ensures dialogs are redrawn when full redraw is needed")

    print("TEST RESULTS:")

    print("✓ Dialogs are redrawn when full redraw is needed")

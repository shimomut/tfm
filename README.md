## Quick Start

### Installation

> **Want the desktop app?** The easiest way to run TFM in desktop mode is to
> download and install a prebuilt application package — a self-contained
> `TFM.exe` folder on Windows or a native `.app` on macOS, with Python and every
> dependency bundled in (no source checkout, no virtualenv). These packages are
> **not yet uploaded to GitHub Releases** — until then, use the from-source setup
> below (which also covers terminal mode on Windows, macOS, and Linux).

TFM's UI runs on **[PuiKit](https://github.com/crftwr/puikit)**, a separate
framework that is not yet published to PyPI. The simplest setup checks out PuiKit
next to TFM and lets the Makefile wire everything into a virtualenv.

1. Install Python 3.10 or later. On macOS, Homebrew is the easiest route:
   ```bash
   brew install python@3.14
   ```
2. Clone TFM and PuiKit side by side:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crftwr/puikit.git
   git clone https://github.com/shimomut/tfm.git
   cd tfm
   ```
3. Create the environment and run (installs base deps **plus PuiKit editable**):
   ```bash
   make venv        # creates .venv using the newest python3 in PATH
                    # expects PuiKit at ../puikit; override with PUIKIT_DIR=/path/to/puikit
   make run         # launch TFM
   ```

   `make venv` creates and populates `.venv/`, and every other `make` target runs
   through that interpreter — so you never need to activate it yourself.

   Prefer to manage the environment yourself? Create and activate a virtualenv
   first, then install the dependencies and PuiKit manually:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate         # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e ../puikit          # PuiKit (editable) — required
   python3 tfm.py
   ```

   **Desktop Mode** runs on Windows and macOS. The Windows GUI backend is pure
   Python and needs nothing extra; the macOS one uses PyObjC, installed
   automatically by `requirements.txt`. Just pick the backend:
   ```bash
   python3 tfm.py --backend gui   # native desktop window on Windows or macOS
   ```

### Essential Controls

## Archive Virtual Directory Browsing

TFM lets you browse archive files as if they were regular directories - no extraction needed!

**Supported formats:** `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, `.tar.bz2`, `.tar.xz`

**How to use:**
1. Navigate to any archive file
2. Press `Enter` to browse its contents
3. Navigate directories inside the archive with arrow keys
4. Press `Enter` on files to view them
5. Copy files out with `C` (or your copy key)
6. Search within archives with `Alt+F7`
7. Press `Backspace` to exit the archive

**What you can do:**
- Browse nested directories within archives
- View text files with syntax highlighting
- Copy files and directories from archives to local/S3
- Search for files by name or content
- Select multiple files for batch operations
- Sort by name, size, date, or extension

See [Archive Feature](doc/ARCHIVE_FEATURE.md) for complete documentation.

## Built-in File Viewers

Press `V` (or `Enter`) to view the selected file. TFM picks the right viewer for the file type — all of them work seamlessly on local files, inside archives, and on remote SFTP / S3 paths without extraction or download.

### Text viewer

A powerful text viewer with syntax highlighting for 20+ file formats.

![Text viewer](doc/images/text-viewer.jpg)

- Syntax highlighting for Python, JavaScript, JSON, Markdown, YAML, and more
- Line numbers, horizontal scrolling, line wrapping (`W`), and in-file search
- Multiple encoding support (UTF-8, Latin-1, CP1252)

**Enhanced highlighting:** `pygments` (installed via `requirements.txt`) enables full syntax support.

### Rich viewers — Markdown, JSON, CSV/TSV

For structured files, the viewer offers a *rendered* view in addition to the raw text. Press `M` inside the viewer to toggle between the formatted and raw views.

| Markdown | JSON / JSONL | CSV / TSV |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src="doc/images/markdown-viewer.jpg" width="280"> | <img src="doc/images/json-viewer.jpg" width="280"> | <img src="doc/images/csv-viewer.jpg" width="280"> |
| Rendered headings, lists, code, and links | Collapsible, syntax-colored tree (`.json`, `.jsonl`, `.ndjson`) | Column-aligned table grid (`.csv`, `.tsv`) |

### Image viewer

A modal image viewer with zoom, pan, and prev/next navigation through the sibling images in the current pane.

![Image viewer](doc/images/image-viewer.jpg)

- Supports PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, WebP, TIFF, ICO, and more (via Pillow)
- Renders inline in graphics-capable terminals (iTerm2, kitty, sixel) and in desktop mode; falls back to a metadata card (format / dimensions / size) elsewhere
- Zoom with `+` / `-`, pan with the arrow keys or a mouse drag, step through images with prev/next

Image decoding needs `pillow` (installed via `requirements.txt`).

## Themes & Visual Effects

TFM ships a dozen built-in themes. Press `T` to cycle to the next theme, or pick one from the **View → Theme** menu — your choice is remembered across restarts. Define your own in `~/.tfm/config.py` and they appear in the picker alongside the built-ins.

| | | |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src="doc/images/theme-dark.jpg" width="260"><br>**Dark+** | <img src="doc/images/theme-monokai.jpg" width="260"><br>**Monokai** | <img src="doc/images/theme-dracula.jpg" width="260"><br>**Dracula** |
| <img src="doc/images/theme-nord.jpg" width="260"><br>**Nord** | <img src="doc/images/theme-solarized.jpg" width="260"><br>**Solarized** | <img src="doc/images/theme-gruvbox.jpg" width="260"><br>**Gruvbox Dark** |
| <img src="doc/images/theme-light.jpg" width="260"><br>**Light+** | <img src="doc/images/theme-solarized-light.jpg" width="260"><br>**Solarized Light** | <img src="doc/images/theme-sci-fi.jpg" width="260"><br>**Sci-Fi** |
| <img src="doc/images/theme-cyber.jpg" width="260"><br>**Cyber** | <img src="doc/images/theme-segment-lcd.jpg" width="260"><br>**Segment LCD** | <img src="doc/images/theme-shinagawa.jpg" width="260"><br>**Shinagawa** |

The default config also includes a **Phosphor** sample theme — a monochrome phosphor-green CRT terminal — as a starting point for your own.

### Visual effects (desktop mode)

In desktop mode (`--backend gui`), a theme can carry visual effects that the GPU renders behind and over the interface. Terminal mode simply shows the theme's colors and ignores these.

- **Background animations** — a slow, on-palette scene drawn behind the panes, rendered as a GPU fragment shader: `starfield`, `rain`, `hologram`, `wave`, `grid`, `constellation`, and `datastream`.
- **Screen post-effects** — a full-frame CRT / phosphor look composited over the UI: bloom, glow, scanlines, vignette, and drop shadows.
- **Text-reveal animations** — filenames and labels *arrive* rather than appear, decoding or typing into place on a directory change (used by Sci-Fi and Cyber).
- **Translucent surfaces** — panels and chrome can sit at reduced opacity so the animated background reads through.

Effects are pure theme data — each is a combination of parameters attached to a theme, so a custom theme can mix and match them without any application code.

## Sub-shell Mode

Press `Shift-X` to temporarily suspend TFM and enter a shell with environment variables providing access to current directories and selected files:

- `TFM_LEFT_DIR`, `TFM_RIGHT_DIR` - Directory paths for each pane
- `TFM_THIS_DIR`, `TFM_OTHER_DIR` - Current and other pane directories  
- `TFM_LEFT_SELECTED`, `TFM_RIGHT_SELECTED` - Selected files in each pane
- `TFM_ACTIVE` - Set to '1' to indicate TFM sub-shell mode

Type `exit` to return to TFM.

## Advanced Features

- **Native Desktop App:** Run in a real window on Windows and macOS (`--backend gui`) with GPU rendering, or in any terminal — same keyboard-driven interface
- **Archive Virtual Directories:** Browse ZIP, TAR, and compressed archives as if they were directories - navigate, search, view files, and copy contents without extraction
- **SFTP Support:** Access remote servers via SSH with full file operations, search, and optimized performance through connection multiplexing and bulk operations
- **AWS S3 Support:** Navigate and manage S3 buckets with seamless local/remote operations
- **Rich Viewers:** Built-in viewers for text (syntax-highlighted), images (zoom/pan), Markdown, JSON, and CSV/TSV — plus text and directory diff viewers
- **Themes & Effects:** A dozen built-in themes with GPU background animations, CRT/phosphor screen effects, and text-reveal animations in desktop mode
- **Batch Rename:** Regex-based renaming with capture groups and macros
- **Threaded Search:** Non-blocking filename and content search with progress tracking (works inside archives and on remote servers)
- **Pane Management:** Resizable layout, directory sync, state persistence
- **External Integration:** VSCode, Beyond Compare, and custom program support

For detailed information on all features, see the [User Guide](doc/TFM_USER_GUIDE.md).

## Command Line Options

```bash
# Run in terminal mode (default)
python3 tfm.py

# Run in desktop mode (native window on Windows or macOS)
python3 tfm.py --backend gui

# Specify startup directories
python3 tfm.py --left /path/to/projects --right /path/to/documents

# Combined usage - desktop mode with custom directories
python3 tfm.py --backend gui --left ./src --right ./test

# Help and version
python3 tfm.py --help
python3 tfm.py --version
```

The full flag set is just `--backend {tui,curses,gui,macos,windows}`, `--left DIR`,
`--right DIR`, `--version`, and `--help`.

### Backend Selection

TFM supports two rendering backends, chosen with `--backend`:

- **Terminal Mode** (`--backend tui`, alias `curses`): traditional terminal interface, works on all platforms (**Windows, macOS, Linux**) — the default
- **Desktop Mode** (`--backend gui`): native desktop window on **Windows** (Direct2D/DirectWrite) or **macOS** (CoreGraphics, via PyObjC). The `gui` alias resolves to the right backend for the current platform; `windows` / `macos` name them explicitly.

Desktop mode provides:
- Native window with resizing and full-screen support
- Customizable fonts (`MONO_FONT_NAME` / `UI_FONT_NAME` / `FONT_SIZE`)
- Window size and position remembered automatically across runs
- Better color accuracy with true RGB colors, plus GPU-rendered theme background animations and screen effects

See the [Desktop Mode Guide](doc/DESKTOP_MODE_GUIDE.md) for detailed desktop mode configuration.

## Installation

### Requirements

**All modes:**
- [PuiKit](https://github.com/crftwr/puikit) — TFM's UI framework, installed editable from a sibling `../puikit` checkout (`make venv` / `make install-puikit`). Not on PyPI.

**Terminal Mode** (all platforms — Windows, macOS, Linux):
- Python 3.10+ with curses library (built-in on macOS/Linux, 3.14 supported)
- Windows: `pip install windows-curses` (installed automatically via `requirements.txt`)
- Terminal with curses support (Linux is terminal-mode only — desktop mode is Windows/macOS)

**Desktop Mode** (Windows or macOS):
- Python 3.10+ (3.14 supported)
- Windows: 10 or later — the GUI backend is pure Python (Direct2D/DirectWrite), no extra dependency to install
- macOS: 10.13 (High Sierra) or later — PyObjC (installed automatically via `requirements.txt`)

### Dependencies

**PuiKit** (required — TFM's UI framework, editable from a sibling checkout):
```bash
pip install -e ../puikit   # or: make install-puikit  (PUIKIT_DIR=../puikit by default)
```

**Base dependencies** — `requirements.txt` is the single source of truth and is
installed in one shot:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It pulls in:
- `pygments` — enhanced syntax highlighting (20+ file formats)
- `pillow` — the built-in image viewer (decode / crop / scale; also enables inline terminal images)
- `boto3` — AWS S3 support (cloud storage operations)
- `watchdog` — automatic directory-listing reload on file changes
- `pyobjc` — macOS desktop mode (selected automatically on macOS)
- `windows-curses` — terminal-mode curses support on Windows (selected automatically on Windows)

The last two use environment markers, so the platform-specific dependency for the
machine you are on is installed for you. There is no `[macos]` extra to request.
(The Windows desktop backend itself is pure Python and needs no build step.)

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Run Directly (No Installation)
```bash
# Create and activate a virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate         # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies + PuiKit (editable, from a sibling ../puikit checkout)
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ../puikit

# Terminal mode (all platforms)
python3 tfm.py

# Desktop mode (native window on Windows or macOS)
python3 tfm.py --backend gui
```

#### Option 2: Install as Package
```bash
# Install from source directory
cd tfm

# PuiKit is required and not on PyPI — install it (editable) first
pip install -e ../puikit

pip install .

# Run from anywhere (installs a `tfm` console command)
tfm                # Terminal mode
tfm --backend gui  # Desktop mode (Windows / macOS)
```

#### Option 3: Development Installation
```bash
# Install in editable mode (changes reflected immediately)
cd tfm

# PuiKit is required and not on PyPI — install it (editable) first
pip install -e ../puikit

pip install -e .

# Run from anywhere
tfm
```

## Configuration

TFM is highly configurable through `~/.tfm/config.py`. Access configuration via the Settings menu (`Shift-Z` key) or edit manually.

**Key areas:**
- Themes, color schemes, and visual effects (including custom themes)
- Key bindings (fully customizable)
- External programs, file associations, and text editor
- Favorite directories and startup paths
- Performance and behavior settings

> TFM's UI framework, **PuiKit**, is **not** in this tree — it lives in its own
> repository (`../puikit`) and is installed editable into the virtualenv.

## Troubleshooting

**Installation Issues:**
- Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed (PuiKit, TFM's UI framework, requires 3.10+)
- Check terminal compatibility with curses library (terminal mode)
- PyObjC (desktop mode) installs automatically on macOS via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Desktop Mode Issues:**
- Desktop mode runs on Windows and macOS; on other platforms use terminal mode
- On macOS, if PyObjC is missing TFM automatically falls back to terminal mode
- Check console output for backend initialization messages
- See [Desktop Mode Guide](doc/DESKTOP_MODE_GUIDE.md) for detailed setup

**Performance Issues:**
- Install `pygments` for better text viewer performance
- Check available memory for large directory operations
- First access to large archives may be slow while structure is cached
- Desktop mode provides better performance with GPU acceleration

**Archive Issues:**
- Verify archive file is not corrupted
- Ensure you have read permissions for the archive
- Check supported formats: `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, `.tar.bz2`, `.tar.xz`
- Archives are read-only - use copy operations to extract files

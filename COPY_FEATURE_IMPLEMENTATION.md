# Copy Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the C key copy functionality for the TUI File Manager (TFM). The feature allows users to copy selected files to the directory of the opposite file list panel, with full support for recursive directory copying and conflict resolution.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Key Binding
- **Keys**: `c` and `C`
- **Action**: `copy_files`
- **Configuration**: Added to both `_config.py` and `tfm_config.py`

### 2. Smart File Selection
- Copies all selected files if any are selected (using Space key selection)
- Copies current file if no files are selected
- Prevents copying parent directory (`..`) entry
- Supports both files and directories

### 3. Recursive Directory Copying
- Uses `shutil.copytree()` for complete directory structure preservation
- Maintains file permissions and timestamps with `shutil.copy2()`
- Handles nested subdirectories and files correctly

### 4. Conflict Resolution
- Detects existing files in destination directory
- Shows multi-choice dialog with three options:
  - **Overwrite**: Replace existing files
  - **Skip**: Copy only non-conflicting files  
  - **Cancel**: Abort the entire operation
- Uses existing dialog system for consistent UI

### 5. User Feedback
- Progress messages displayed in log pane
- Detailed error handling with descriptive messages
- Automatic pane refresh after copying
- Selection clearing after successful copy
- Copy count reporting

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. `_config.py`
```python
'copy_files': ['c', 'C'],  # Added to KEY_BINDINGS
```

#### 2. `tfm_config.py`
```python
'copy_files': ['c', 'C'],  # Added to DefaultConfig.KEY_BINDINGS
```

#### 3. `tfm_main.py`
- Added key handler in main loop
- Implemented three new methods:
  - `copy_selected_files()` - Main entry point
  - `copy_files_to_directory()` - Conflict detection and resolution
  - `perform_copy_operation()` - Actual copy execution

### Key Handler Integration
```python
elif self.is_key_for_action(key, 'copy_files'):  # Copy selected files
    self.copy_selected_files()
```

### Method Signatures
```python
def copy_selected_files(self):
    """Copy selected files to the opposite pane's directory"""

def copy_files_to_directory(self, files_to_copy, destination_dir):
    """Copy a list of files to the destination directory with conflict resolution"""

def perform_copy_operation(self, files_to_copy, destination_dir, overwrite=False):
    """Perform the actual copy operation"""
```

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Usage
1. **Single File Copy**: Navigate to file â†’ Press `C`
2. **Multiple Files Copy**: Select files with `Space` â†’ Press `C`
3. **Directory Copy**: Navigate to directory â†’ Press `C`

### Conflict Handling
When files already exist in the destination:
1. Dialog appears with options
2. Use arrow keys to navigate or hotkeys:
   - `O` - Overwrite existing files
   - `S` - Skip conflicting files
   - `C` - Cancel operation
3. Press `Enter` to confirm selection

### Visual Feedback
- Copy progress shown in log pane
- Error messages for permission issues
- Success confirmation with file counts
- Automatic UI refresh to show copied files

## Error Handling

### Permission Errors
- Checks destination directory write permissions
- Handles individual file permission errors gracefully
- Continues copying other files if some fail

### File System Errors
- Handles missing source files
- Manages disk space issues
- Provides descriptive error messages

### Edge Cases
- Prevents copying parent directory (`..`)
- Handles empty selections appropriately
- Manages same-directory operations

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- âœ… Configuration integration
- âœ… Key binding functionality
- âœ… Single file copying
- âœ… Multiple file copying
- âœ… Recursive directory copying
- âœ… Conflict detection and resolution
- âœ… Error handling
- âœ… User interface integration

### Test Files Created
- `test_copy_feature.py` - Basic functionality tests
- `test_copy_integration.py` - Integration tests
- `test_copy_comprehensive.py` - End-to-end tests
- `verify_copy_implementation.py` - Implementation verification

## Integration Status

### âœ… Completed
- Configuration system integration
- Key binding system integration
- Multi-choice dialog system integration
- File operation system integration
- Error handling system integration
- Log system integration
- UI refresh system integration

### ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Use
The copy feature is fully implemented and tested. Users can immediately start using the `C` key to copy files between panes with full conflict resolution support.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Potential Improvements
- Progress bar for large directory copies
- Copy queue for background operations
- Undo functionality for copy operations
- Copy with rename option for conflicts
- Symbolic link handling options

### Performance Optimizations
- Async copying for large files
- Memory-efficient copying for huge directories
- Parallel copying for multiple files

## Conclusion

The copy feature has been successfully implemented with comprehensive functionality that matches professional file manager standards. The implementation integrates seamlessly with TFM's existing architecture and provides a robust, user-friendly copying experience with proper error handling and conflict resolution.

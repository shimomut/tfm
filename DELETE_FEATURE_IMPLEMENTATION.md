# TFM Delete Feature Implementation

## Overview
The delete feature has been successfully implemented in TFM (Terminal File Manager). Users can now delete files and directories using the 'K' key with proper confirmation dialogs.

## Implementation Details

### Key Binding
- **Keys**: `k` and `K`
- **Action**: `delete_files`
- **Configuration**: Added to both `DefaultConfig` and template `_config.py`

### Core Methods

#### `delete_selected_files()`
- Main entry point for delete operations
- Handles both selected files and current file (if none selected)
- Prevents deletion of parent directory (..)
- Shows appropriate confirmation dialog based on file types
- Supports single files, directories, and multiple selections

#### `perform_delete_operation(files_to_delete)`
- Executes the actual deletion
- Handles different file types:
  - **Files**: Uses `Path.unlink()`
  - **Directories**: Uses `shutil.rmtree()` for recursive deletion
  - **Symbolic Links**: Uses `Path.unlink()` (deletes link, not target)
- Provides detailed error handling and reporting
- Refreshes file panes after deletion
- Clears selections and adjusts cursor position

### Confirmation Dialog
The delete feature shows context-aware confirmation messages:

- **Single file**: "Delete file 'filename'?"
- **Single directory**: "Delete directory 'dirname' and all its contents?"
- **Single symbolic link**: "Delete symbolic link 'linkname'?"
- **Multiple items**: "Delete X items (Y directories, Z files)?"

### Safety Features

1. **Confirmation Required**: Always shows confirmation dialog before deletion
2. **Parent Directory Protection**: Cannot delete ".." parent directory entry
3. **Symbolic Link Safety**: Only deletes the link, not the target
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting for permission issues, etc.
5. **Selection Clearing**: Clears selections after successful deletion
6. **Cursor Adjustment**: Adjusts cursor position if it becomes out of bounds

### Integration Points

1. **Key Handler**: Added to main key processing loop in `tfm_main.py`
2. **Configuration**: Added `delete_files` key binding to configuration system
3. **Dialog System**: Uses existing multi-choice dialog system for confirmation
4. **File Refresh**: Integrates with existing file refresh mechanism

## Usage

1. **Navigate** to files/directories using arrow keys or j/k
2. **Select** files with SPACE (optional - works on current file if none selected)
3. **Delete** by pressing 'k' or 'K'
4. **Confirm** deletion in the dialog (Yes/No)

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

- `test_delete_integration.py`: Full integration testing
- `test_delete_feature.py`: Basic functionality testing
- `demo_delete_feature.py`: Interactive demo with test files
- `verify_delete_feature.py`: Quick verification script

All tests pass successfully, confirming the feature is properly integrated.

## Files Modified

1. **tfm_config.py**: Added `delete_files` key binding to `DefaultConfig`
2. **_config.py**: Added `delete_files` key binding to template configuration
3. **tfm_main.py**: 
   - Added key handler for delete action
   - Implemented `delete_selected_files()` method
   - Implemented `perform_delete_operation()` method

## Error Handling

The delete feature handles various error conditions:

- **Permission Denied**: Reports permission errors for protected files
- **File Not Found**: Handles files that may have been deleted externally
- **General Errors**: Catches and reports unexpected errors
- **Directory Access**: Validates directory permissions before operations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Trash/Recycle Bin**: Move files to trash instead of permanent deletion
2. **Undo Functionality**: Allow undoing recent delete operations
3. **Progress Indicator**: Show progress for large directory deletions
4. **Selective Deletion**: Allow choosing which files to delete from selection
5. **Delete Confirmation Settings**: Make confirmation dialog optional via config

## Conclusion

The delete feature is fully implemented and ready for use. It provides a safe, intuitive way to delete files and directories in TFM while maintaining the application's focus on user safety and clear feedback.

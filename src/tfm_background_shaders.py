"""TFM's background scenes — the animated fields drawn behind the file panes.

Every scene TFM offers is a fragment shader, evaluated per pixel on the GPU. That
is a deliberate consolidation: scenes used to come in two kinds, and the CPU kind
(line segments stroked by the backend) lost on every axis that mattered. Density
cost CPU time per segment, the whole scene was stroked in a single color, and —
the one that decided it — a segment scene was drawn *inside* the UI's render pass,
so animating it repainted the entire UI every frame no matter how little it drew.
A shader owns a layer behind the UI, which the backend advances without touching a
UI pixel, so an idle TFM with a background costs a fraction of what it used to.

**Writing one.** A scene is a single fragment function named ``puikit_bg_fragment``.
PuiKit prepends its prelude — the uniform struct and a fullscreen vertex stage — so
the source here is just that function::

    fragment float4 puikit_bg_fragment(float4 pos [[position]],
                                       constant BackgroundUniforms &u [[buffer(0)]])

``u`` carries ``resolution`` (pixels), ``time`` (seconds, already scaled by the
theme's speed), ``opacity``, and the theme's ``ink``/``backdrop`` as RGBA — so a
shader stays on-palette without knowing anything about TFM's theme system. The
source is compiled when the theme is applied; one that fails to compile draws
nothing and logs the compiler error, so a typo costs a blank background.

**Every scene ships twice.** Shader source is the one genuinely backend-specific
part of a background: macOS compiles Metal Shading Language, Windows compiles HLSL,
and they are different languages. So each scene is a pair named for its dialect —
``<SCENE>_MSL`` and ``<SCENE>_HLSL`` — holding the same maths, and the registry at
the bottom pairs them. No compiler checks one against the other, so tuning one and
forgetting the twin is the standing hazard here; ``test_background_shaders.py``
compares the two sets of constants to catch exactly that.

**The per-pixel inversion.** A CPU scene walks its objects and draws them. A shader
is asked, for one pixel at a time, "what covers you?" — so every scene here needs a
way to answer that without visiting everything. The recurring device is a *grid*: an
object's identity comes from hashing its cell index, so a pixel can compute which
cells could possibly reach it and consult only those. The rain visits its own column
and two neighbours, the starfield cells along a depth ray, the constellation a 5x5
block of nodes. The wave takes the idea furthest: it *texture-maps* its cells rather
than walking them, sampling a procedural dot field in the sheet's own plane, which
decouples its particle count from its per-pixel cost entirely. Where a scene needs
per-object randomness it hashes the cell index rather than calling anything
time-varying, so an object keeps a fixed identity across frames and all motion comes
from ``time``.

#: A flowing sheet of particles — a wave surface rendered as a point cloud.
#:
#: Structure: the surface is a sum of travelling sine trains, sampled at a stack of
#: depth layers. Rather than *placing* particles, each layer **texture-maps** them:
#: a procedural dot field is sampled in the sheet's own (x, z) plane, and the layer
#: keeps whatever dots sit at the height that projects onto this pixel. That
#: inversion is what makes the particle count free — density is the texture's
#: frequency, not a loop bound — and it is why this scene draws several times the
#: particles of the cell-walking version it replaces at slightly *less* cost.
#:
#: There is no texture *asset*: puikit's background shaders take uniforms and bind
#: no images (see puikit ``SHADER_PRELUDE``), so the dot field is generated in
#: place. That is the better trade anyway — a procedural field is infinite, tiles
#: without a seam, and can be sampled at any frequency, so nothing has to be
#: uploaded or kept resident to make the sheet denser.
#:
#: Three octaves of that field are sampled per layer, each **rotating** in the
#: plane at its own slow rate. Rotation is what turns a fixed lattice into drifting
#: particles, and because the rates are mutually incommensurate the octaves never
#: re-align — the sheet churns instead of sliding, and never visibly repeats.
#:
#: The colour is the part the CPU renderer could never do: hue shifts along the
#: sheet and toward the crests, so the wave runs cool in its troughs and pales to
#: near-white where it peaks, in the spirit of the reference. It is anchored on the
#: theme's ``ink`` so it still belongs to the palette rather than ignoring it.

#: Stars streaming toward the viewer, drawn as radial motion streaks.
#:
#: Structure: stars sit on a bounded plane in front of the camera and travel only in
#: depth; the perspective divide sweeps them outward from the centre and accelerates
#: them as they near. The plane is *bounded* — that is what gives the field a
#: vanishing point, since a far layer covers only the middle of the view and opens
#: outward as it approaches.
#:
#: The per-pixel inversion is the interesting part. A star at plane position ``s`` and
#: depth ``z`` lands at ``s/z`` in normalised coordinates, so a pixel can run that
#: backwards: at an assumed depth, ``s = n * z`` names the exact cell that could
#: cover it. Depth is sampled in layers — each layer a full grid of stars sharing one
#: depth, the layers evenly offset in phase so some are always near and some far. A
#: layer recycles when its depth wraps, which is invisible because the fade-in has it
#: at zero alpha exactly there.
#:
#: A streak spans a range of depths, so the covering star lies somewhere along the
#: pixel's ray between the plane radius of its head and that of its tail. For any
#: *on-screen* pixel that span works out to well under one cell, so sampling the two
#: ends brackets it — which is why this costs two lookups per layer and not a search.

#: Drifting nodes linked to their near neighbours, edges fading with distance.
#:
#: This is the scene that fought the per-pixel form hardest, and the one place the
#: port is a *reinterpretation* rather than a translation. Its identity is global
#: nearest-neighbour topology — which pairs are linked depends on where every node
#: is — and that is exactly what a shader, asked about one pixel at a time, cannot
#: survey. So the field is rebuilt on a grid: one node per cell, its position and
#: motion hashed from the cell index.
#:
#: The cell is sized so the link radius spans a little over one cell
#: (:data:`LINK_CELLS`). That ratio is load-bearing in both directions. Too large and
#: every node links to everything nearby; too small — a cell *equal* to the link
#: radius, the obvious first choice — and a regular grid puts every neighbour at
#: almost exactly the link distance, where the distance falloff sends the edge to
#: zero alpha and the net renders as bare dots. At 1.4 cells a typical neighbour sits
#: at ~0.7 of the radius, so edges are actually visible and the orbits below spread
#: the rest across the falloff.
#:
#: That ratio also bounds the search: an edge reaches at most 1.4 cells, so for any
#: pixel an edge crosses, both endpoints lie within a link of it and therefore inside
#: the 5x5 block around it. Cells whose nearest corner is already out of range are
#: rejected before their node is even evaluated, so the usual cost is far below the
#: 25 that bound allows.
#:
#: What changed, deliberately. The CPU scene drifted nodes in straight lines that
#: wrapped at the view border; a wrapping node cannot stay in the cell that owns it,
#: and the cell is how a pixel finds it. So a node orbits inside its own cell
#: instead — a circle at constant angular speed, with its own radius, rate and
#: handedness. That directly answers the objection the original raised against
#: sinusoidal paths: a sine dwells at its turning points and piles nodes up, while a
#: circle traversed at constant speed has no turning points and is uniform in time.
#: The character survives (a calm net, drifting, edges dissolving as nodes part);
#: what is gone is a node crossing the entire window over half a minute.

#: Horizontal data traffic — layered tracks of dashes streaming past the viewer.
#:
#: The look this chases is a telemetry wall seen side-on: rows of bright segments of
#: many lengths sliding by at different rates, faint tick marks standing between
#: them, the whole field clumping into busy and quiet regions. Where :data:`RAIN_MSL`
#: falls, this *travels* — the two are the same idea rotated, but the differences
#: that matter are the ones a rotation does not give you: parallax layers, a
#: leading-edge hot head, and the vertical connectors.
#:
#: Structure: each layer is a stack of rows, and a row is a lane of dashes. A pixel
#: finds its row by division and its dash by another, so it consults exactly one cell
#: per layer — no neighbour visits at all, because a dash is contained in its cell by
#: construction (the cell *is* the dash's slot; only its length varies). That is the
#: cheapest form the grid device takes anywhere in this module, which is what pays
#: for running several layers.
#:
#: Layers recede by a constant factor in pitch, cell length, speed and brightness, so
#: the far ones read as distance rather than as clutter. Every row flows the same
#: direction and differs only in rate: counter-flowing rows read as noise, while a
#: shared direction reads as travel.
#:
#: **Time is folded, not accumulated.** A lane's offset grows without bound, and
#: feeding ``x + t*speed`` straight into the cell hash would lose the fractional part
#: to float32 after a long uptime — the dashes would start to jitter on a machine
#: left running for days. So the offset is split into its integer cell count and its
#: fraction: the fraction positions the pixel inside a cell, the integer only
#: *identifies* which cell (wrapped at :data:`_DS_WRAP` cells, ~10^5 px of travel, so
#: the hash input stays exact). The field repeats after that, which is unobservable
#: and the whole point.

#: A depth of holographic panels drifting toward the viewer — the data-wall look.
#:
#: Structure: a stack of planes at increasing depth, each tiled into cells, each cell
#: hosting one **panel** — a small flat HUD of rules, blocks and pseudo-text. A plane
#: sweeps from far to near and recycles, so panels grow and slide outward as they
#: approach and pass. This is :data:`STARFIELD_MSL`'s depth machinery carrying a
#: *drawing* instead of a dot, and it inherits that scene's key property: a panel's
#: identity comes from its position on the plane, which never moves, so approaching
#: it magnifies it rather than morphing it.
#:
#: A panel draws one of six things — typed pseudo-text, a bar chart, a line chart,
#: progress bars, a ring gauge, or a wireframe mesh — picked by a hash and read off a
#: threshold chain, so only the winning branch costs anything. Text is much the
#: commonest; the charts are punctuation.
#:
#: **Why the content is procedural blocks and not text.** A background shader is
#: handed uniforms and binds no textures — there is no font to sample, and glyph
#: rasterisation in a fragment function would cost more than the whole rest of the
#: scene. So a row of "text" is a run of blocks with text's *rhythm*: varied widths,
#: short gaps, a common baseline. At the size panels actually occupy that is what the
#: reference reads as anyway; the legibility was never there to lose.
#:
#: What it does need is text's **order**. A row types out left to right, holds, then
#: retypes with fresh content, with the mark under the head burning brighter — the
#: caret. Re-rolling every slot at once (what this did first) costs nothing less and
#: reads as noise: writing order is most of what identifies a row as writing.
#:
#: **Three nested grids, one lookup each.** Cell → panel, panel → row, row → block:
#: a pixel divides its way down to exactly one block and hashes it. Nothing is
#: iterated but the depth planes, which is what lets the field be this dense.
#:
#: **Speed.** Panels creep toward the viewer and the ambient field drifts at a few
#: pixels a second, which between them make a scene that barely appears to move. The
#: *fast layer* — barcode bursts, dashes and dots running along horizontal lanes — is
#: the one element with real pace, and it is what keeps the whole thing from reading
#: as a still image under a slow zoom.
#:
#: **The concentration lines** raking outward from the vanishing point are the
#: datastream's dash-in-a-slot wrapped around the centre — a pixel finds its angular
#: sector and its slot along the ray and consults one cell, so the whole field costs
#: about what one more depth plane would. They earn their place by selling the motion
#: the panels only imply: panels *grow*, but nothing about them streaks.
#:
#: **Resolution-aware fade.** Depth means far panels pack their rows tighter than a
#: pixel can resolve, and drawing them anyway turns the far field into crawling
#: noise. Each panel measures a pixel against its own row pitch — computed
#: analytically from the depth, since ``fwidth`` is undefined under the non-uniform
#: branching this scene is built from — and fades out where it can no longer be read.
#: That is also what bounds the cost of the far planes rather than the plane count.
#:
#: **The warm accent.** The reference punctuates its cyan with amber, and a shader
#: gets exactly one theme colour (``ink``). The accent is therefore the ink with red
#: and blue swapped: on the cyan this scene is written for that lands on amber
#: exactly, and on any other palette it stays a hue derived from the theme rather
#: than a colour imported from outside it.

"""Geometry (and shared chrome) for pane-anchored dialogs.

A picker that acts on one pane (filter, favorites, drives, an input prompt) is
anchored over that pane so the user can see which side it targets. It reads as
belonging to the pane by being *centered over it*, but its width is independent
of the pane: a narrow pane (splitter dragged over) must not shrink the dialog.
The box keeps its own desired width and just leans over its target pane.

This module also owns :func:`draw_title_bar`, the one place every TFM modal draws
its title bar, so the bold title and the rule beneath it look identical across
the input, filter-list, scroll, and batch-rename dialogs.

    Blind middle-elision cuts wherever the character budget happens to run out,
    so ``/Users/crftwr/projects/tfm/src`` degrades to ``/Users/crf…/tfm/src`` —
    a fragment of a directory name that names nothing. This drops *entire*
    components instead, so every name left on screen is a real one, and keeps
    the two parts that carry the most meaning: the anchor (root, ``~``, or
    ``scheme://host``) and the leaf (where you actually are).

    A ``scheme://`` prefix is never abbreviated, and on local paths the user's
    home directory contracts to ``~`` before any components are dropped —
    often enough on its own to make the path fit.

    Args:
        path_str: The location to display.
        avail: Budget in the same units ``measure`` returns.
        measure: Callable mapping a string to its display width. Defaults to
            ``len`` (character cells); pass ``ctx.measure_text`` on a vector
            backend, where glyphs are not uniformly wide.
        home: Home directory to contract to ``~``. Defaults to ``Path.home()``;
            pass explicitly in tests to avoid depending on the environment.

    Returns:
        The path, abbreviated only as much as ``avail`` requires.

    Examples:
        >>> abbreviate_path('/Users/me/projects/tfm/src', 80)

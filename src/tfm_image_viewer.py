"""ImageViewer — a modal image viewer with zoom, pan, and sibling navigation.

The fourth full-window modal viewer (after text / file diff / directory diff),
built on the same skeleton: a ``cover`` layer pushed over the file manager, a
header band naming the file, a footer status bar of live key hints, and a help
overlay. Push it with :func:`show_image_viewer`.

Three interactions, all resolved as *geometry* rather than re-encoded pixels:

- **Zoom** — ``1.0`` fits the whole image in the window (letterboxed); each step
  multiplies by :data:`ZOOM_STEP` up to :data:`MAX_ZOOM`. Once zoomed, the image
  is grown past the client area and clipped to it (:meth:`_fill_geometry`), so it
  *fills* the body instead of floating in a letterbox — the standard image-viewer
  behaviour. Dest and source stay proportional, so nothing is distorted.
- **Pan** — the arrow keys (and a mouse drag) move the view center by a fraction
  of the *visible* extent, so a step feels the same however far in you are. The
  center is clamped to what the client area can reach, so panning to an edge
  slides the image flush (never shrinks it) and reversing moves immediately.
- **Prev / next** — the viewer is handed the sibling images from the pane it was
  opened from, so navigation walks the file list the user was already looking
  at, in the order they see it.

Non-local files (S3, SSH, inside an archive) have no filesystem path for the
backend or Pillow to open, so their bytes are materialized to a temp file for
the life of the viewer and cleaned up on close (see :meth:`_resolve`).

Where the picture cannot be drawn at all — a terminal with no inline-image
protocol, or a missing Pillow — the viewer shows a metadata card (format,
dimensions, file size) instead of the Panel's lone alt glyph, so opening an
image still tells you something about it. Zoom and pan are hidden in that mode;
prev/next still work.

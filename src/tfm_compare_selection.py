"""Compare & Select — the storage-agnostic engine behind the ``compare_selection``
action (ttk TFM's ``W`` key, rebuilt for the PuiKit port).

Each entry in the active pane is joined to the same-named, same-type (file-vs-dir)
entry in the other pane, after NFC-normalizing names. An entry is selected when
every *enabled* attribute relation holds; entries with no counterpart are selected
only when ``include_missing`` is set. This module is pure and headless — the dialog
(``tfm_compare_dialog``) builds a :class:`CompareCriteria`, and the app folds the
returned path set into ``pane['selected_files']``.

The relations subsume the legacy three-way menu and add direction:

- ``size``    — ``any`` / ``equal`` / ``differs``   (ignored for directories)
- ``mtime``   — ``any`` / ``same`` / ``newer`` / ``older``   (relative to other pane)
- ``content`` — ``any`` / ``equal`` / ``differs``   (byte compare; ignored for dirs)

``stat``-only comparisons (size / mtime) are cheap and are called only on
name-matched pairs. A content comparison reads both files, so callers route it
through the task worker; a size mismatch short-circuits it (files are only read
when their sizes already match). The optional ``checkpoint`` callable is invoked
between entries and between chunks so a worker can raise to cancel.

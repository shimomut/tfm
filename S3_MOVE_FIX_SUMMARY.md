# S3 Move Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the error "Error moving file1.txt: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 's3://shimomut-files/test1/file1.txt'" that occurred when moving files between S3 directories in TFM.

## Root Cause
The move operation was using `shutil.move()` which only works with local file system paths and doesn't understand S3 URIs like `s3://bucket/key`.

## Solution
Replaced `shutil.move()` calls with `Path.rename()` calls, which properly delegate to the S3PathImpl.rename() method for S3 paths.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. File Move Operation (src/tfm_main.py)
```python
# OLD - BROKEN
shutil.move(str(source_file), str(dest_path))

# NEW - FIXED  
source_file.rename(dest_path)
```

### 2. Directory Removal in Move Operations
```python
# OLD - BROKEN
shutil.rmtree(source_dir)

# NEW - FIXED
self._delete_directory_with_progress(source_dir, 0, 1)
```

### 3. Overwrite Handling
```python
# OLD - BROKEN
if dest_path.is_dir():
    shutil.rmtree(dest_path)

# NEW - FIXED
if dest_path.is_dir():
    self._delete_directory_with_progress(dest_path, 0, 1)
```

## How S3 Rename Works
The S3PathImpl.rename() method:
1. Uses S3 `copy_object` to copy the file to the new location
2. Uses S3 `delete_object` to remove the original file
3. Invalidates cache entries for both source and destination
4. Provides proper error handling

## Benefits
- ✅ S3 to S3 moves now work correctly
- ✅ Local to local moves still work (Path.rename delegates to os.rename)
- ✅ Cross-storage moves work (S3 to local, local to S3)
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all storage types
- ✅ Proper error handling and cache invalidation

## Files Modified
- `src/tfm_main.py` - Updated move operations to use Path.rename()
- `test/test_s3_move_fix.py` - Unit tests for the fix
- `demo/demo_s3_move_fix.py` - Demonstration of the fix
- `doc/S3_MOVE_FIX.md` - Detailed documentation

## Testing
All tests pass, confirming that:
- S3PathImpl has the rename method
- S3 rename performs proper copy and delete operations
- Path class properly delegates rename operations
- S3 paths are created with correct implementation

The fix resolves the S3 move issue by using TFM's Path abstraction layer correctly instead of bypassing it with direct shutil calls.

# S3 Directory Deletion Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
When trying to delete S3 directories (e.g., `s3://shimomut-files/test1/dir3/dir2/`), TFM displayed the error "No files to delete" even when the directory existed and contained files.

## Root Cause
The S3PathImpl `exists()` method only checked for explicit S3 objects using `head_object()`. For directories without explicit directory markers, this returned `False` even though the directory conceptually existed (had objects with that prefix).

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed S3PathImpl.exists() Method
**File**: `src/tfm_s3.py`

Modified the `exists()` method to check if a path is a directory when the direct object check fails:

```python
def exists(self) -> bool:
    """Whether this path exists"""
    try:
        if not self._key:
            # Check if bucket exists
            self._cached_api_call('head_bucket', Bucket=self._bucket)
            return True
        else:
            # Check if object exists
            self._cached_api_call('head_object', Bucket=self._bucket, Key=self._key)
            return True
    except ClientError as e:
        if e.response['Error']['Code'] in ['404', 'NoSuchBucket', 'NoSuchKey']:
            # If direct object doesn't exist, check if it's a directory
            # (i.e., there are objects with this key as a prefix)
            return self.is_dir()
        raise
```

### 2. Added Recursive Deletion Support
**File**: `src/tfm_s3.py`

Added `rmtree()` method for recursive directory deletion:
- Lists all objects with directory prefix
- Deletes objects in batches of 1000 (S3 API limit)
- Removes directory marker if it exists
- Invalidates cache properly

Added `_delete_objects_batch()` helper method for efficient batch deletion.

### 3. Enhanced TFM Directory Deletion Logic
**File**: `src/tfm_main.py`

Modified `_delete_directory_with_progress()` to detect S3 paths and use S3-specific deletion logic.

Added `_delete_s3_directory_with_progress()` method:
- Handles S3 directory deletion with progress tracking
- Uses pagination for large directories
- Provides detailed progress updates
- Handles errors gracefully

## Result
- ✅ S3 directories are now properly detected as existing
- ✅ "No files to delete" error is resolved
- ✅ Recursive deletion works for directories with contents
- ✅ Progress tracking works for large directory deletions
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Efficient batch deletion using S3 APIs

## Files Modified
1. `src/tfm_s3.py` - Fixed exists() method, added rmtree() and batch deletion
2. `src/tfm_main.py` - Enhanced directory deletion logic for S3 paths

## Files Added
1. `doc/S3_DIRECTORY_DELETION_FIX.md` - Detailed documentation
2. `test/test_s3_directory_deletion_fix.py` - Comprehensive tests
3. `demo/demo_s3_directory_deletion_debug.py` - Debug tool
4. `demo/demo_s3_recursive_deletion_test.py` - Test tool

## Testing
The fix has been verified to resolve the original issue:
- Directory `s3://shimomut-files/test1/dir3/dir2/` now shows `exists(): True`
- Directory is properly added to deletion list
- No more "No files to delete" error
- Recursive deletion works for directories with contents
